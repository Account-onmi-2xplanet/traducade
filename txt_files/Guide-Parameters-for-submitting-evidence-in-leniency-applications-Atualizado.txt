51. Introduction
Leniency agreements signed with the Office of the Superintendent General of
CADE (SG/CADE), provided for in Article 86 of Law 12529/2011 (the Brazilian
Competition Law), must result in (a) the identification of other parties involved in the
antitrust practice and (b) the gathering of evidence in the form of information and
documents that prove the violation reported or under investigation.
For this purpose, CADE accepts any data or record that provides a reasonably clear
description of an incident that can be assigned into a category of violation provided in
Article 36 of Law 12529/2011 (the Brazilian Competition Law).
The agreement is signed considering the outcome of proceedings, i.e. a future
situation. The Competition Law establishes that documents and information of a
proceeding initiated from a leniency agreement will prove the violation (in the future);
however, they do not need to prove it at the moment the agreement is signed. It is only
after the due process that the violation should be proven. Taking into account the time
gap between the moment the leniency application is assessed and the moment the
proceeding is heard, we can presume at least two hypotheses in which the expectations
of proof fall short.
The first hypothesis is a leniency agreement that lacks evidence at the time of its
execution but that has high expectations that ex officio administrative actions carried
out during fact-finding will suffice to prove the violation, which includes defendants
collaborating through other means, such as Cease and Desist Agreements. Nevertheless,
the investigative actions or defendants' collaboration may not achieve the expected
outcome.
A second hypothesis is the possibility that the Office of the Superintendent
General and the Tribunal have different positions about the pieces of evidence of a
proceeding.
Although both bodies concur in which type of data proves an anticompetitive
practice, they may have opposing opinions as to which pieces of evidence provide a
reasonable degree of certainty about an antitrust practice in a given case.
6As a procedural rule, in signing a leniency agreement, the Office of the
Superintendent General analyses the evidence presented in the application. On the
other hand, the Tribunal of CADE is the one that renders the judgement.
The leniency agreement is of great advantage to the Tribunal of CADE for its ability
to find against wrongdoers based on information and documents presented by one of
those involved in the violation. Therefore, the Office of the Superintendent General
works to better assess the probability that a given leniency agreement will lead to a
guilty judgement.
This goal may be achieved by providing a clearer definition of the evidential criteria
for conviction, which derives from precedent decisions of the Tribunal of CADE. As
precedents set standards for future decisions, by knowing them in detail, the Office of
the Superintendent General increases its ability to sign agreements that will result in a
judgement against the non-signatories.
Thus, analyzing the case law of CADE’s Tribunal on cartel conduct is important in
leveraging the ability to assess leniency applications.
It should be stressed, however, that investigative actions are preeminently
dynamic. Therefore, the Office of the Superintendent General may consider accepting
leniency applications even when they fall short of the case law standards, provided it
offers a plausible strategy to produce evidence later. Leniency applications may not have
evidence enough to result in a decision against the defendant if the evidence presented
in the applications allows for investigative measures that, in CADE's experience, have
led to complementary information and documents that ultimately prove the facts.
Without prejudice to other circumstances observed in the proceeding at issue, the
practice is more easily investigated if it comprises a fairly recent and highly coordinated
violation with known suspects.
72. Standard of Proof
Standard of proof can be understood as the level of certainty1 necessary to prove
a legal fact2 based on the evaluation of one or more pieces of evidence.
Discussions on the standard of proof arise from the common law system3.
One of the reasons for it is historical. In the 12th century, England had itinerant
justices who had to trust the fact-finding of local communities to adjudicate cases. Thus,
in this scenario, the jury arises as a trier of fact.4
The other reason, resulting from the first one, regards a relevant legal distinction
in Common Law between decreeing the law (a judge's duty) and finding the facts (jurors'
duty) 5. Therefore, the standards are instructions a judge gives to juries and that the
juries should consider during the evaluation of evidence.
Continental law disregarded these standards as for centuries each kind of
evidence had a predetermined and fixed probative value (the so-called "legal proof"
system). This system was mostly abandoned at times of liberal revolutions and
1 “It is said to be given by (1) the degree of confidence in the evidence; (2) the fact-finder's subjective degree of belief,
i.e. the mental or psychological state of the decision-maker; or (3) the strength of evidence, i.e. how much the
evidence confirms an allegation.” Susan Haack, Evidence Matters: Science, Proof, and Truth in the Law (New York:
Cambridge University Press, 2014), p. 17, 52.
Several authors criticise the standards for their reliance on the subjective conviction of the decision-maker,
considering its lack of criteria and the resulting impossibility of an intersubjective control of the decision. Jordi Ferrer
Beltrán, Valoração racional da prova (Salvador: JusPodivm, 2021), p. 247.
2 An event that comes within the scope of a legal provision and leads to legal consequences. In leniency agreement
negotiations, violations are the most important legal facts.

in EU Cartel Investigations’, World Competition Law and Economics Review, 35/3 (2012), pp. 471–509.
Frederick E. Vars makes a good distinction between different standards of proof. "Did O.J. Simpson kill his ex-wife
Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman? A criminal jury said no; a civil jury said yes.' These seemingly
inconsistent verdicts can be reconciled because the juries answered different questions. The issue before the criminal
jury was whether O.J. was proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The issue before the civil jury was whether it
was more likely than not that O.J. killed Nicole and Ronald. Taken together, the juries indicated that they believed
O.J. probably did it, but that there was room for reasonable doubt. Absolute certainty is generally unattainable in
legal proceedings. As a result, triers of fact, like the O.J. juries, are given guidance on how to resolve uncertainty. A
primary guide is the standard of proof-the level of confidence or type of evidence required to decide a case one way
or another.” Fredrick E. Vars, ‘Toward a General Theory of Standards of Proof’, Catholic University Law Review, 60/1
(2011).

Press, 2009), p. 206.
8codification, in the 18th and 19th centuries, in favour of a system of "free conviction",
"intimate conviction", or the free assessment of evidence6.
In the common law system, instructions to jurors in jury trials have a degree of
legal certainty that varies according to what is intended (the production of evidence, a
compensation order, a prison sentence, etc). In this way, they have the function of
“distributing the risk of error” throughout the proceeding.
Of course, any mistake in evidence assessment is not welcomed in the exercise of
governmental power, whether the mistakes are false positives or false negatives.
Nevertheless, as errors are inevitable, not fully knowing the facts imply consequences
that vary according to the values scale of different contemporary democracies. An error
in the criminal law leads to the imprisonment of an innocent person; in civil law, the
error of not compensating a victim is no less serious than the error of finding a defendant
wrongfully held liable for civil wrongdoing7. In the common law system, this generally
means there is a greater standard of proof in criminal proceedings than in civil
proceedings.
The preponderance of the evidence, commonly applied in civil proceedings, only
demands the decision-maker is convinced the legal fact is more probable than not. For
this reason, research quantified it like 51% probability of truth8. Naturally, this
percentage is merely illustrative and does not consider a detailed assessment of facts.
The probabilities intend to determine how jury instructions should be given to reach a
verdict that satisfies the judgement criteria.
The second standard of proof is "clear and convincing evidence", i.e. evidence that
shows the assessed fact is highly probable9 – with at least 71% probability of truth10.

9This standard is usual in civil actions that produce graver effects, such as concerning
citizenship, involuntary commitment, parental rights, succession matters, etc11. Finally,
criminal trials1213 require the highest standard of proof, requiring confidence in the
evidence is beyond a reasonable doubt (illustrated as 91% probability of truth or
over)1415.
Although the idea of formalising standards of proof in this manner is particular to
the common law system, the civil law system, which Brazil adopts, also requires a
reasonable level of confidence and coherent precedents. The idea comes from the
principle of isonomy that requires that, in facing the same situation, different people
should make the same decisions, except when a modification is justifiable.
Thus, we can use here the notion that rules also demand a certain standard of
proof to have a practical effect. Regardless of the legal system, both legal precedents
and rules need a coherent application to be truly enforced, including in the evaluation
of evidence.
11 Tuzet (n. 6 above).
12 Search and seizures and other criminal provisional measures may require a lower standard of proof, such as
probable cause (fair expectations of finding proof of a crime in private premises). In the event a police authority has
reasons to believe there is some risk, the standards are also lower, such as reasonable belief or reasonable suspicion.
13 The contemporary use of the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard faces much criticism in the literature: from the
fact that it is not sufficiently clear to guide the jury about how to decide on facts to difficulties in discerning the
strength of a subjective belief that does not need any justification (jury decisions demand no explanation) from that
of a rationally justified belief. Moreover, even in criminal law, many of the currently imposed penalties (fines,
alternative punishment, etc.) are not as serious as when this demanding standard was set (times in which death
penalties were common). Additionally, today there are resources to correct a miscarriage of justice we did not have
before. Larry Laudan, ‘Is Reasonable doubt reasonable?’, U of Texas Law, Public Law Research Paper No. 144, 2003,
DOI: 10.1017/S1352325203000132

Franklin considers the highest standard above 80%. James Franklin, ‘Case Comment–United States v. Copeland, 369

and Risk, 5 (2006), pp. 159–165.
103. Absence of a predetermined legal value for evidence
As a rule, the Brazilian procedural law includes no legal provision that attributes
fixed values to evidence16. There are, however, a few exceptions, such as Article 158 of
the Brazilian Criminal Procedure Code and Article 1227 of the Brazilian Civil Code. The
former determines that a direct or indirect corpus delicti test is required if there is indicia
of violation and that a guilty plea is not enough evidence to circumvent it. The latter
establishes interest in real property and transfer of property between living persons are
only legal if registered at the Land Registry in which the real property is registered,
except in the cases provided in the same Civil Code. In the exceptions, the law requires
a specific kind of evidence for certain legally relevant facts.
For facts that do not demand specific evidence, the rule is to admit any type of
evidence and require explicit and rational grounds for the decisions. In short, judges
state the grounds for their decisions based on rationality, carefully described beliefs,
and accordingly to observed and proven experience. This methodology is known in Brazil
as convencimento motivado, which establishes judges should give the reasons for their
decisions. Frequently, similar evidence is given an identical value in different cases.
Adopting criteria previously used in other proceedings, such as in the system of binding
case law, provide law enforcement bodies with consistent judicial decisions; thus,
people know what to expect when presenting a body of evidence in court. To some
extent, experience grants value to evidence – although decision-makers can have some
liberty as to precedents, whether because they believe the legal reasoning of a
precedent case does not entirely appl to the case at issue due to different facts, or even
because they understand this legal reasoning should be reviewed.17
16 There are, however, exceptions, such as the fact that an individual's marriage is proved only by its registration at a
register office. We call "legal proof" the system of rules that predetermine the value of evidence.
17 The Federal Administrative Proceeding Law (Law 9784/1999) establishes administrative rulings should include its
reasoning – not only as a principle but as a compulsory requirement:
"Article 50. Administrative acts should be well reasoned, making the legal facts and reasons explicit whenever
they
I. deny, limit, or affect rights or interests;
II. impose or aggravate rights, duties, or sanctions;
III. decide administrative proceedings for civil-servant examinations or selection processes;
11Below, we mention evidence that was essential to decisions to dismiss
proceedings or find against the defendants. We took into consideration cases from 1993
to 2020 in which one or more defendants were found guilty of antitrust violations. We
picked the proceedings in which CADE found against the defendants because they made
explicit what evidence effectively proved the existence of violations18. As leniency
agreements usually happen in cartel cases, cartels were the predominant violation in
the examples we provided.
4. Review of CADE's case law
Based on its experience with leniency negotiations and comparative and
regulatory analyses, CADE research of its Tribunal's precedent decisions for
administrative proceedings of cartels and induction of concerted practices issued
between 1993 and 2020.
To this end, first, examples of evidence the Tribunal used in demonstrating cartel
activities were collected. Next, the Tribunal's considerations were divided into the
following categories: (1) direct evidence of agreement; (2) indirect evidence of
agreement; (3) evidence of the practice's effects in Brazil; (4) sufficient evidence; (5)
insufficient evidence, when presented in isolation; (6) valid evidence; (7) evidence used
to distinguish hard-core and soft-core cartels.
See each of these topics below, with the most relevant precedent decisions for
each of them.
IV. exempt from procurement requirements due to specific circumstances provided by law or declare
procurement processes infeasible in the situation in question.
V. decide administrative appeals;
VI. derive from a mandatory review;
VII. fail to apply a well-established precedent on the matter or differ from official expert opinions, reports, and
proposals;
VIII. annul, revoke, stay, or confirm an administrative act."
18 Except for Item 4.6, "Insufficient evidence, when presented in isolation", in which we used precedents from
proceedings that, due to insufficient evidence, were dismissed or had the allegations against one or more defendants
dismissed.

4.2. Direct evidence of an agreement
"A cartel is any agreement or concerted practice between competitors to fix prices,
divide markets, allocate market quotas or restrict production, rig bids in government
procurement, or that has any competitively sensitive information as its object. By causing
price rises and supply restrictions and offering no economic benefit, cartels inflict serious
harm to consumers, making goods and services unavailable for some and unnecessarily
expensive for others". 34
We consider direct the kind of evidence that is directly linked to the illegal practice
it attempts to prove, that is, an agreement to coordinate competitors' behaviour and
thus avoid or diminish competition.
There are several ways to provide direct evidence of collusive agreements in
cartels: reports and testimonies; communication between competitors (e-mails, chat
messages, fax, mail, etc.); internal communication mentioning the agreement (e-mails,
chat messages, etc.); unilateral documents providing information on the agreement
(notes in a schedule, spreadsheets, etc.); documents shared between competitors

Inciting concerted practices is also illegal per the Brazilian antitrust legislation.
Thus, the following are also relevant evidence:
v. Influencing the adoption of concerted practices: unions, membership
associations and outsourced consulting firms can exceed their organisational roles and
36 Cover bidding is "arranged to give an appearance that bidders are competing against each other. This sort of
arrangement happens when individuals or companies agree on submitting proposals concerning at least one of the
following: (1) One of the competitors agrees on submitting a proposal with prices higher than the ones offered in the
proposal submitted by the bidder chosen to win the procurement process; (2) A competitor deliberately submits a
proposal that is too overpriced to be accepted; or (3) A competitor submits a proposal with specificities that are
known to be unacceptable to the purchaser". (CADE's Guide for Fighting Cartels in Procurements, 2019. Available at:
https://cdn.cade.gov.br/Portal/centrais-de-conteudo/publicacoes/guias-do-cade/guide-for-fighting-cartels-in-
procurements_version_01-10.pdf).
37 "Bid-suppression schemes involve agreements among competitors in which one or more companies agree to refrain
from bidding or to withdraw a previously submitted bid so that the designated winner's bid will be accepted. In
essence, bid suppression means that a company does not submit a bid for final consideration. In essence, bid
suppression means that a company does not submit a bid for final consideration." (Guidelines for Fighting Bid Rigging
in Public Procurement. OECD, 2012).
38 "Conspiring firms continue to bid, but they agree to take turns being the winning (i.e., lowest qualifying) bidder."
(Guidelines for Fighting Bid Rigging in Public Procurement. OECD, 2012).
39 "Competitors carve up the market and agree not to compete for certain customers or in certain geographic areas.
Competing firms may, for example, allocate specific customers or types of customers to different firms, so that
competitors will not bid (or will submit only a cover bid) on contracts offered by a certain class of potential customers
which are allocated to a specific firm. In return, that competitor will not competitively bid to a designated group of
customers allocated to other firms in the agreement." (Guidelines for Fighting Bid Rigging in Public Procurement.
OECD, 2012).
40 The designated contract winner undertakes to compensate the companies that cooperated through bid
suppression or cover bidding by subcontracting, thus sharing the uncommonly high profits earned with the illegal
collusive agreement. (Guidelines for Fighting Bid Rigging in Public Procurement. OECD, 2012).

Cartel agreements and concerted practices usually aim at developing many
activities other than the collusive agreements, such as monitoring compliance with the
agreement and sanctioning deviating participants, submission of bids at a fixed price,
suppression of bids, entry barriers, creation of fake consortia, amongst others. Evidence
related to such actions directly prove cartels but are only considered direct evidence
inasmuch as the records confirm the content of the arrangement. Moreover, one should
note that affirming the existence of a collusive practice is a prerequisite for the analysis
of the evidence of cartel activities; that is, direct evidence of other activities depends on
the existence of a collusive agreement.
4.3. Indirect evidence of an agreement
Indirect evidence (also known as circumstantial evidence) does not directly prove
an agreement but is useful to understand the conduct under investigation, possibly
leading to a finding that results from logical inference. The indirect evidence is "not the
principal fact but a different one from which a rational conclusion on the principal fact
can be reached." Hence, "this type of evidence offers adjudicators information that can
only be used to draw an inference that ultimately leads to the principal fact of the
case"44.
A kind of circumstantial evidence often used in cases adjudicated by the authority
is the probability of a cartel being formed in a specific market, according to the structure
and history of this market. Although not as robust as direct evidence or even other types
44 Michele Taruffo, A prova, (São Paulo: Marcial Pons, 2014), p. 58.
21of indirect evidence, such information helps understand a communication proved by
direct evidence or other indirect evidence.
Signs of a collusive agreement's monitoring can be considered direct or indirect
evidence, according to the content and circumstances of the communication.
4.3.1. Economic evidence
Some market features facilitate collusive agreements. Additionally, certain
economic phenomena of a market have collusion as their most probable cause.
Researched by the economics, these situations – together with other assessed evidence
– help develop a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon under investigation.
The Tribunal of CADE has repeatedly found the following to be circumstances that
facilitate collusion:
1. Features of the market: Product homogeneity, similar cost structure,
transparent prices or conditions of sale, high barriers to entry, low price elasticity of
demand, and market concentration are structural conditions that facilitate collusion.
See cases no. 08700.010769/2014-64, 08012.001377/2006-52, 08012.010744/2008-71,

2. Close personal or professional relations: Having family or common
business partners in companies' management positions may enable the sharing of
information and create a situation in which there is no competition, possibly giving rise
to actions to fake competition. See cases no. 08012.000742/2011-79,
08012.011791/2010-56, 08012.008184/2011-90, and 08012.011142/2006-79.
3. Membership associations: They are bodies that inherently coordinate the
activities of companies or members45. However, it is common that they deviate from
45 As to the anticompetitive risks of membership associations' meetings, Gesner Oliveira and João Grandino Rodas
paraphrased Adam Smith, saying: "In its classic 1776 work, The Wealth of Nations, Smith stated that ‘People of the
same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy
22their functions and illegally coordinate anticompetitive practices such as cartels or the
sharing of sensitive information. See cases no. 08012.011791/2010-56,
08012.009462/2006-69, 08012.001273/2010-24, 08012.005004/2004-99,
08012.001826/2003-10, and 08012.002299/2000-18.
4.3.2. Evidence of collusive agreement oversight
The stability of an anticompetitive agreement depends on mechanisms to monitor
its implementation and punish participants who deviate from its rules. The sharing of
sensitive information is, at large, what enables these mechanisms.
If a piece of evidence that proves monitoring activities also confirms the content
of these arrangements, it is direct evidence. If the content of the arrangements cannot
be confirmed but only inferred, it is indirect evidence. Even in case one cannot safely
infer the existence of an agreement from a piece of evidence, this piece may
nonetheless prove an infraction of exchange of sensitive information, considering its
potential effects. A third hypothesis is that the practice constitutes lawful
communication if it cannot potentially lessen competition.
Therefore, to prove illegal cartel activity, the evidence must indicate the existence
of the following:
1. Mechanisms to monitor an agreement and to punish nonconforming
participants: There must be formal or informal manners to oversee the implementation
of the anticompetitive agreement, in addition to sanctions imposed on participants who
deviate from it. Coercion, threats, and even reprisals are usual whenever a non-
complying participant is discovered. See cases no. 08700.010409/2015-4346,
08700.010769/2014-64, 08012.001377/2006-52, 08012.011980/2008-12,

2. Sharing of competitively sensitive information, even when there is no
evidence of sanctions: These are interactions between competitors, whether direct or
mediated by third parties (such as unions or membership associations), aimed at sharing
competitively strategic data, such as prices, conditions of sale, and customer portfolios.
The shared data is disaggregated, not public, and may refer to a current or a future
situation; it is employed to monitor compliance with the agreement50. See cases no.

50 When cartels cannot be inferred from the evidence, this practice can be deemed an independent violation of
sharing competitively sensitive information. See case no. 08700.001486/2017-74 and the definition rendered by the
rapporteur of case no. 08700.001422/2017-73: "Thus, there is a distinction between the sharing of competitively
sensitive information and a softcore cartel. To distinguish between these practices, one should analyse not only how
sensitive the shared information is but also if the evidence collected in the proceeding – i.e. the elements of the case
at issue – prove the existence of coordination or a structured agreement between market players. If that is not the
case, I believe the practice should be classified as the sharing of competitively sensitive information, which calls for an
examination of its effects. However, if the communication is essentially about an agreement or arrangement, the
practice should be considered a cartel and, thus, examined as a per se violation".

4.3.3. Evidence of ignorance of the law
In making a finding that a given violation happened and a defendant is guilty of it,
it is useful to prove the defendant knew the practice was illegal. Demonstrating a
wrongdoer understood the illegality of the practice, was concerned with this fact and
tried to conceal the practice usually are grounds for inferring the existence of an
agreement. Moreover, in calculating the sanction, a defendant's understanding of the
illegality of an act is an aggravating factor as it suggests a lack of good faith. Therefore,
one should look for evidence that demonstrates the following:
1. Mechanisms to conceal the agreement: Parties to an anticompetitive
agreement employ abbreviations, aliases, codes, and other strategies to conceal or
make it difficult to identify the terms and participants. See cases no.
08012005069/2010-8254, 08012.001395/2011-00, 08012.001376/2006-16,

08012.002127/2002-14, and 08012.007515/2000-31.
2. Concern with the investigations or knowledge of the investigations:
Participants of collusion who know they are under investigation or show concern
about being investigated by competent authorities. See cases no.

08012.005495/2002-14, and 08012.001826/2003-10.
3. Express reference to the illegality of a practice or repeat offences:
Participants show, in their communication, familiarity with antitrust legislation and
state the practice is illegal or have undisputed knowledge of its illegality due to
previous conviction. See cases no. 08012.005255/2010-11, 08012.000820/2009-11,
08012.006969/2000-75, 08012.011027/2006-02, and 08012.004472/2000-12.
4.4. Evidence of a practice's effects in Brazil
CADE's precedents agree that cartels are punishable because they are per se
violations, that is, the authority presumes they have a deleterious effect on competition
or consumer welfare.56
Debate on international cartels, however, demands not only evidence of the
practice, but also that CADE demonstrates it has jurisdiction over the matter by showing
the connection between the international cartel and the Brazilian market. An
international cartel is one whose activities are managed from abroad. The link with the
Brazilian market exists when the practice effectively or potentially affects transactions
in the Brazilian territory (Article 2 of Law 12529/2011).
In establishing CADE's jurisdiction over a practice carried out abroad, one should
look for evidence with these characteristics:
1. Direct or indirect mentions of Brazil or Brazilian customers: Documents
that demonstrate the agreement included Brazil, South America, Latin America or even
the global market without expressly excluding Brazil. The same applies to mentions of
56 As an example, see the opinion of Commissioner Marcos Paulo Verissimo in case no. 08012.006923/2002-18 and
the following documents: document no. SEI 0752279 (Commissioner Mauricio Bandeira Maia's opinion in case no.
08700.009879/2015-64); document no. SEI 0793414 (Commissioner Luiz Braido's opinion in case no.
08012.007011/2006-97); document no. SEI 0534141 (Commissioner Paula Azevedo's opinion in case no.
08012.000758/2003-71); document no. SEI 0264382 (Commissioner Alexandre Cordeiro's opinion in case no.
08012.009645/2008-46); and document no. SEI 0583001 (Commissioner João Paulo Resende's opinion in case no.
08012.001377/2006-52).
26Brazilian customers. See cases no. 08012.003970/2010-10, 08700.003735/2015-02,
08012.002414/2009-92, 08012.010932/2007-18, and 08012.004599/1999-18.
2. Dependence on the affected product's imports: The data must show
Brazil's dependence on the importation of the affected product, in addition to the
defendants' broad participation in supplying the product. Whenever the practice has an
impact on intermediate goods, it is important to demonstrate the input constitutes a
great part of the final good's value. See cases no. 08700.009167/2015-45,
08012.011980/2008-12, 08012.001395/2011-00, 08012.001376/2006-16,
08012.005255/2010-11, and 08012.004599/1999-18.
3. Meetings in the Brazilian territory: If proved that meetings between
participants happened in the Brazilian territory, one should also indicate its effects on
the country, as the territory criterion is met as per Article 2 of Law 12529/2011. See
cases no. 08012.002414/2009-92, 08012.011027/2006-02, and 08012.004702/2004-77.
4.5. Sufficient evidence
To prove a cartel and to be convinced the defendants are guilty of it, CADE's
Administrative Tribunal requires the administrative proceeding has strong and robust
evidence of the conduct. Such body of evidence must preferably include the following
features:
1. Diverse evidence and/or indicia: A body of evidence made of several
pieces of evidence and/or indicia of many kinds that come from a variety of sources is
usually recognised and persuasive. See cases no. 08012005069/2010-8257,
08700.003735/2015-02, 08012.000820/2009-11, 08012.001029/2007-66,
08012.011142/2006-79, 08012.010215/2007-96, 08012.000283/2006-66, and
08012.002127/2002-14.
2. Corroborating evidence and/or indicia: Evidence and/or indicia that
confirm each other in a proceeding make up a cohesive, coherent, and harmonic body
of evidence. See cases no. 08012.001395/2011-00, 08012.011980/2008-12,
57 Administrate proceeding split from case no. 08012.000820/2009-11.

08012.011027/2006-02.
3. Decisions reached solely on the grounds of indirect evidence: A firm body
of evidence solely made up of indirect evidence can lead to a guilty verdict. See cases
no. 08012.005069/2010-82, 08700.005615/2016-12, 08012.004422/2012-79,
08012.000820/2009-11, and 08012.001273/2010-24.
4. The existence of an agreement to manipulate the market is beyond a
reasonable doubt: Cases dismissed once the Tribunal found a reasonable doubt about
the existence of arrangements to manipulate the market. See cases no.
08012005069/2010-8258, 08700.001422/2017-73, 08700.007938/2016-4159,
08700.010769/2014-64, 08700.011276/2013-6060, and 08012.007149/2009-39.
5. Agreement/guilty verdict in other jurisdictions: The fact in another
jurisdiction a defendant was found guilty or signed an agreement pleading guilty of a
violation, in addition to evidence proving said violation had effects on Brazil, favours the
conclusion on the existence of an illegal agreement – whether totally or partially
executed abroad – punishable in the Brazilian territory. See cases no.
08012.001395/2011-00, 08012.001376/2006-16, 08012.001127/2010-0761,

6. Confession: A confession or admission of participation in an antitrust
practice, especially in settlement agreements executed with CADE or other Brazilian
authorities in charge of cartel prosecution, in addition to other evidence that shows
signs of an agreement to manipulate competition, have helped to make a finding of a
58 Administrate proceeding split from case no. 08012.000820/2009-11.

08012.011027/2006-02.
4.6. Insufficient evidence, when presented in isolation
Often, some evidence presented in isolation, without corroboration of other direct
or indirect evidence, has been considered insufficient to prove either that a violation
has been committed or that the defendant has partaken in it. See the most frequent
cases below:
1. Unilateral documents or accounts: Accounts from employees or third
parties, as well as notes and internal communication recorded by a single party to a
proceeding, especially if an employee, is not considered sufficient evidence of
anticompetitive conduct in isolation. See cases no. 08012.011980/2008-12,
08012.001395/2011-00, 08012.004674/2006-50, 08012.004422/2012-79,
08012.001029/2007-66, and 08012.009906/1999-94.
2. Economic evidence and parallel behaviour: Similar behaviour as to prices
and price rises may have reasons other than a cartel; thus, they cannot be considered in
isolation to find a defendant guilty. See cases no. 08012.007866/2007-07,
08700.003447/2015-40, 08012.007196/2009-82, 08012.009988/2006-49,

08012.000444/2002-98, 08012.000921/2000-53, 08012.006059/2001-73,

08012.008166/1999-14, and 08012.004241/2003-51.
3. Phone records: One cannot infer the anticompetitive content of
communication between competitors solely based on phone call records if the topic of
these calls is unknown. See cases no. 08012.001395/2011-00, 08012.004422/2012-79,
and 08700.009161/2014-9764.

64 Administrate proceeding split from case No. 08012.000774/2011-74.
294. Reference to an individual or legal entity in third parties' communication:
The mere mention of an individual or legal entity in third parties' communication, such
as intercepted communication, cannot prove the participation of the individual or entity
in an anticompetitive practice. See cases no. 08700.009879/2015-64,
08700.000729/2016-76, and 08012.007356/2010-27.
5. Documents without date and/or authorship: The lack of signature or
author and impossibility of proving its date of publication (if before or after the alleged
practice), or even difficulties in checking its veracity, make it impossible to prove in
isolation someone guilty. See cases no. 08700.004617/2013-41 and
08012.006667/2009-35.
6. Being copied in an email: It is not possible to determine whether a
defendant participated in an anticompetitive practice based only on emails in which he
or she was copied. Even if a defendant is the main recipient of an email, this fact may
not be enough to find he or she was engaged in the violation, especially if the defendant
does not answer it or does not show agreement. In assessing this kind of evidence, one
should also consider the position the defendant holds in the company. See cases no.
08700.011474/2014-05, 08700.004617/2013-41, and 08012.002812/2010-42.
7. Scheduled meetings or mentions of meetings: By themselves, the mere
scheduling of meetings or reference to them in communication between competitors
cannot allow inference of its anticompetitive goal or content. See cases no.
08012.011980/2008-12, 08700.004617/2013-41, 08012.004422/2012-79, and
08012.004241/2003-51.
8. Anonymous tips: The credibility and evidential value of anonymous tips
derive from the substantial evidence collected, not from mere accounts (Article 5,
Paragraph 4 of the Brazilian Constitution of 1988). See cases no. 08012.007196/2009-
82, 08012.000998/1999-83, and 08012.006768/2000-78.
We highlight that this document presents precedents in which proceedings have
been dismissed in their entirety or concerning one or more defendants due to
insufficient evidence. The precedents shown here only include decisions by the collegial
30body and only the positions that were affirmed by different judgements. We did not
consider positions adopted in dissenting opinions.
4.7. Validity of evidence presented
In a proceeding, we only admit lawfully obtained evidence. Evidence obtained by
infringing rights is considered illegal. In some cases, the evidence demands a special
procedure that, if not followed, affects its validity. This may occur, for instance, if the
production of certain evidence requires legal authorisation (e.g. a search and seizure
without a warrant or a recording of a phone conversation that breaches the law).
In admitting evidence, another frequent and relevant question concerns granting
the right to full answer and defence65 in the administrative proceeding.
The CADE Tribunal has often mentioned the validity of evidence concerning the
topics below:
1. Evidence produced by other bodies66: CADE also admits evidence
produced in proceedings adjudicated by different bodies that may corroborate other
evidence presented in the administrative proceeding. For this purpose, the evidence
must have been admitted in the original proceeding (and thus have fulfilled the legal
requirements for that). If a piece of evidence demands legal authorisation to be
produced, the same applies to be used in the administrative proceeding adjudicated by
CADE. See below a few instances of this kind of evidence and their respective
precedents:
a. Telephone tapping: When none of the parties to a conversation knows it
is being recorded. Thus, legal authorization is required. The following administrative
proceedings used evidence from criminal cases, authorised by the competent authority.
65 Constitution of Brazil of 1998, Article 5, Item LV: "in judicial or administrative proceedings, litigants and defendants,
in general, are ensured the right to make full answer and defence, with all the means and resources inherent to it".
66 Precedent 591: "Using evidence from administrative disciplinary proceedings, provided it is legally authorised and
that the right to make full answer and defence is granted". (PRECEDENT 591, FIRST SECTION, adjudicated on 13
September 2017, published in Diário de Justiça Eletrônico in 18 September 2017.

08012.004036/2001-24, and 08012.002299/2000-18.
b. (Criminal) search and seizure: Search and seizures of documents in
premises where they may be located must be previously authorised by law. The
following proceedings used evidence from criminal cases, with the competent
authority's permission. See cases no. 08012.004280/2012-40, 08012.004674/2006-50,
and 08012.000820/2009-11.
c. Evidence produced in other administrative proceedings: It is also possible
to use the evidence collected in other administrative proceedings. See case no.
08012.005928/2003-12.
d. Evidence produced in a foreign jurisdiction: Evidence presented in an
administrative proceeding can come from a different jurisdiction. See case no.
08012.004599/1999-18.
2. Recordings made by one of the parties to the communication: Audio and
video recordings made by one of the parties to the communication can be used even
without authorisation from the other parties to the communication. Producing this kind
of evidence does not require legal authorisation, except in the cases of telephone
tapping and interception of data from third parties' communication. See cases no.

323. Civil search and seizures: This kind of measure, set forth in Law
12629/201169 (the Brazilian Competition Law), is adopted at the fact-finding stage of an
administrative proceeding and aims to select and confiscate documents in targeted
premises. It depends on previous legal approval. As the success of a search may depend
on the investigated party's knowledge of it, the right to full answer is delayed. See cases
no. 08012.006130/2006-22, 08012.009611/2008-51, 08012.004702/2004-77, and
08012.001826/2003-10. All evidence discovered during a lawful search is admitted, even
if fortuitous, as seen in case no. 08012.006130/2006-22.
4. Documents in foreign languages: If a practice was committed abroad and
has had anticompetitive effects in Brazil, any foreign-language document presenting
evidence of this practice is admitted, including judgements and settlement agreements
from other jurisdictions. To be valid in CADE's administrative proceedings, the
documents must be written in Portuguese or be accompanied by a sworn translation70.
See cases no. 08700.004617/2013-41, 08012.005255/2010-11, 08012.010932/2007-18,
and 08012.002925/2009-12.
5. Expert report: It is a study on a fact or document prepared by someone
with technical knowledge of the matter at issue. A particularly complex object of analysis
can increase the quantity and quality of the information in a proceeding. CADE admits
reports that respect the right to make full answer and defence. See cases no.

69 Article 13, Item VI, Subitem d: "request from the judicial branch, through the Office of the Attorney General at
CADE, search and seizure warrants for objects, documents of any sort, as well as ledgers, computers and electronic
files belonging to firms or individuals, which are of interest to any administrative enquiry or administrative proceeding
launched to impose sanctions for antitrust violations. Article 839 to 843 of Law 5869/1973 is to be applied, when
appropriate, without the need for filing a proceeding within the judicial branch".
70 Law 6015/1973, "Article 129. To be binding upon third parties, the following documents must be notarised: (...)
Paragraph 6: All foreign documents, accompanied by their respective translations, to be effective in bodies of the
Union, States, Federal District, Cities, and Territories in any instance, court, or appellate court".
71 Although the expert report presented in case no. 08012.008215/2006-45 was admitted in the body of evidence, it
could not be considered evidence because it failed to observe the right to full answer and defence in its production.
72 Although the expert report presented in case no. 08012.002921/2007-64 was admitted in the body of evidence, it
could not demonstrate the existence of any illegal activity as it lacked the dates, the company involved and the name
of its employees. Moreover, it included inaudible passages, noise, and had no anticompetitive content.
334.8. Evidence of a practice's degree of coordination
CADE's precedents categorise cartel conduct into softcore and hardcore cartels
depending on how organised a cartel is. Penalties imposed by CADE grow according to
a cartel's degree of coordination. It is important to remember that "the difference
between a hardcore and a softcore cartel is in the coordination of the agreement, and
not in its presumed negative effects"73. The CADE Tribunal assigned the following cartels
into these categories:
i. Hardcore cartel: It is an agreement between competitors "with a certain degree
of coordination, aimed at fixing prices and conditions of sale, allocating customers, fixing
production levels, or preventing the entry of new companies into the market. This kind
of cartel operates through an established mechanism of coordination, e.g. regular
meetings, operational guidelines, codes of conduct, etc. Therefore, it does not occur by
accident but by formulating lasting mechanisms to attain its goals"74. Hardcore cartels
often, but not necessarily, have monitoring and retaliation mechanisms. Since these
cartels intend to perpetuate market manipulation, they tend to be considered
particularly serious, although it is always necessary to analyse the case at issue and the
practice's circumstances. The Tribunal found defendants guilty of participating in
hardcore cartels in the following proceedings: Cases no. 08012.011980/2008-12,
08700.010769/2014-64, 08012.002812/2010-42, 08012.004674/2006-50,

adopted in recent decisions, such as in case no. 08012.001376/2006-16, heard in 2018.
34ii. Softcore cartel: This kind of cartel is "an act of coordination between companies
with a similar goal to that of a hardcore cartel, but of a fortuitous, not organised, nature.
This is the case when a group of companies decides to gather to agree on a price rise,
often as a result of an external event that affected them at the same time. The action
may be considered fortuitous as it was not based on a permanent arrangement to
coordinate the actions of the involved companies"75. Since it is a one-time event, it is
usually not as serious as a hardcore cartel – although it can be, depending on the
circumstances. Softcore cartels were seen in the following proceedings: Cases no.
08700.001422/2017-73, 08012.004280/2012-40, 08012.004422/2012-79,
08012.008215/2006-45, and 08012.006019/2002-11.
5. Conclusion
The above research on precedents represents an important tool to help the Office
of the Superintendent General negotiate leniency agreements. It assists CADE in
examining the probability of discovering an anticompetitive practice and finding non-
signatories of the leniency agreement guilty of the practice. Therefore, the conclusions
and cases listed above should be taken into account when screening leniency
applications filed with the Office of the Superintendent General.
The Tribunal has admitted several types of evidence in deciding on the existence
of cartels and their participants. In this regard, leniency applicants have several kinds of
evidence to consider using when heading towards internal investigations. Ranging from
the minutes of a meeting to internal and external email exchanges, from economic
evidence to expert reports, there are many ways of substantiating claims with evidence.
Amongst the several types of evidence presented, CADE particularly values direct
evidence, as it is directly connected to the allegedly illegal practice. Nonetheless, CADE
may enter a judgement against a defendant based on pieces of indirect evidence76, as
75 Case no. 08012.002127/2002-14, document no. SEI 0124996, heard in 2005. Case no. 08012.006019/2002-11,
document SEI No. 128309, heard in 2008. These are opinions rendered by the rapporteur of these cases,
Commissioner Luiz Carlos Delorme Prado. Despite being issued some time ago, the same position has been adopted
by recent decisions, such as in case no. 08012.004422/2012-79, heard in 2018.
76 Evidence that proves the circumstances through which one can infer a violation.
35long as there are many of them and they converge to the same understanding of the
facts.
Moreover, the research showed the Tribunal prefers a holistic77 and systemic
assessment of the evidence. Thus, a body of evidence with a diversity of mutually
corroborated direct/indirect evidence can be considered sufficient to prove a defendant
is guilty of an antitrust violation. If these conditions are met, a violation can be proved
even on the grounds of indirect evidence alone. Additionally, guilty decisions,
agreements signed with other jurisdictions, and offenders' confessions can assist an
adjudicator in making findings regarding an antitrust violation and its wrongdoer.
For practices that occurred abroad, it is crucial to show the practice potentially or
effectively affected the Brazilian market.
77 The holistic approach should not be understood as a perspective to support narratives irrespective of their quality
or their relevance in a body of evidence. The holistic approach is defended in Susan Haack's take on civil liability, for
instance:
"The epistemological argument is that, under certain conditions, a congeries of evidence warrants a conclusion to a
higher degree than any of its components alone would do; the legal argument, interlocking with this, is that our
evidence law encourages a kind of atomism that can actually impede the process of arriving at the conclusion most
warranted by the evidence".
What would be these conditions? According to Susan Haack, a combination of pieces of evidence allow for a more
conclusive finding than the individual pieces of evidence when, and only when,
(i) it helps support a finding (the evidence and conclusion fit in the same narrative);
(ii) it enhances the "independent security" of evidence favourable to the conclusion (the evidence is
secure, independently from parties' allegations about it) or reduces the "independent security" of
evidence unfavourable to the conclusion;
(iii) it enhances comprehensiveness of the body of evidence (e.g. evidence obtained from different sources
or through different methods that points in the same direction).
Thus, this idea covers three different dimensions as to the way each piece of evidence is integrated into the
conclusion.
However, Ronald Allen is even closer to a holistic approach, as he defends the merits of the explanatory narratives as
an important part of the decision-making process,
"An explanation is, others things being equal, better to the extent that it is consistent, simpler, explains
more (consilience), better accords with background beliefs (coherence), is less ad hoc, and so on; and is
worse to extent it betrays these criteria (...) Explanations do not explain evidence in its entirety;
explanations explain aspects of evidence. Explanations rarely explain why A; they explain why A rather
than B. The inferential interests at stake pick out the appropriate contrasts (or “foils”) – whether we want
to explain why A rather than B or why A rather than C (or D, etc.). A verdict will (and should) be rendered
for the better (or best available) explanation, whether one of the parties’ or another constructed by the
fact-finder. If the proffered explanations truly are equally bad (or good), including additionally constructed
ones, judgment will (and should) go against the party with the burden of persuasion."
36Some evidence presented in isolation, however, was deemed insufficient for a
guilty verdict. The Tribunal's most commonly rejected evidence are the following:
documents presented by a single party, especially when the party is an employee of the
reported company (the signatory of a leniency agreement or cease and desist
agreement); documents with financial records showing parallel behaviour; telephone
records; references to individuals or legal entities in third parties' communication;
documents without an author and/or a date; being copied in an email; scheduled
meetings and/or reference to meetings; and anonymous tips.
In contrast, these have regularly been admitted as evidence by the Tribunal:
telephone recordings made by a party to the call; evidence produced in non-criminal
search and seizures, as long as legally authorised, including evidence found by chance;
evidence produced in other proceedings, including criminal proceedings that include
legally authorised telephone tapping and search and seizures; documents in foreign
languages; and expert reports. It is important to highlight the right to full answer and
defence must always be respected.
Finally, the evidence presented influences the Tribunal's assessment of the level
of coordination of a cartel and, consequently, the levied punishment. When the
evidence is at least able to show that an anticompetitive arrangement is lasting and well
organised, with a structure that includes mechanisms to monitor compliance and punish
deviating behaviour, the practice is considered a hardcore cartel. Conversely, when the
evidence demonstrates it is a one-time and not organised practice, the practice is
considered a softcore cartel.
