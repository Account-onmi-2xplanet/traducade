6Presentation
This Guide for Antitrust Remedies presents the best practices and procedures
usually adopted by the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) for
determining, applying and monitoring antitrust remedies. The Guide aims to ensure
predictability and transparency as to the activities of CADE.
According to Article 61 of Law 12529/2011, antitrust remedies are applied as
conditions to eliminate potentially harmful effects of a merger or acquisition. The
remedies aim at preventing that mergers result in diminishing competition in a
significant part of the relevant market, in increasing the likelihood of coordination
amongst competitors, in creating or strengthening a dominant position, or even in
controlling a relevant market of goods or services, as per articles 36 and 88 of Law
12529/2011.
Thus, if a merger is not fully cleared, imposing remedies are necessary for its
clearance. However, Article 88 provides that if applying remedies to a merger or
acquisition that harms competition is unfeasible, the Tribunal of CADE must decide for
blocking said transaction.
The antitrust remedies may be negotiated with applicants through a Merger
Control Agreement (ACC in its acronym in Portuguese). The ACC is suggested by the
Office of the Superintendent General of CADE (SG), when the SG challenges the case
to the Tribunal, or is determined as a decision of the Tribunal, as per Articles 161, 165
and 168 of the Statutes of CADE.
Remedies can also be determined unilaterally by the Tribunal of CADE or be
established through a Cease and Desist Agreement (TCC in its acronym in Portuguese)
in cases of anticompetitive practices under the terms of articles 36 and 38 of Law
12529/2011. Considering the information below, the remedies here mentioned shall
concern cases of merger and acquisitions only; although they can be applied to
anticompetitive practices.
Against this backdrop, the Guide for Antitrust Remedies is developed as a
guideline to civil servants, applicants, interested third parties and society regarding the
design, adoption and monitoring of future remedies.
This Guide is disposed as follows: Section 1 presents the general aspects of
antitrust remedies, such as their definition, type, legal basis and goals; Section 2
concerns the principles and general guidelines for effective remedies; Section 3 presents
structural remedies, considering
7asset package, buyer, and divestiture process; Section 4 introduces behavioural remedies
along with best practices and due diligence for its appliance; Section 5 regards trustees
and in which situations they provide assistance; Section 6 concerns the monitoring and
review of Merger Control Agreements (ACC), as well as fines and penalties related to
it; Section 7 regards applicants' compliance with the ACC; and, lastly, Section 8
provides additional information regarding regulated sectors and international
cooperation on mergers that involve other authorities. At last, in the Annex Section, the
Guide provides a Glossary, a trustee Term and a Waiver of Confidentiality.
This guide is non-binding and should not be considered as a rule; therefore, it
does not change nor substitute provisions of the Statutes of CADE. The practices and
procedures herein described can change at CADE's convenience and opportunity,
depending on the circumstances of the concrete case.
81 Antitrust Remedies: basic notions
1.1 Definition
An antitrust remedy consist of a procedure, imposed by CADE or negotiated
between CADE and the Applicants, as a condition for the clearance of a merger.
Antitrust remedies include (i) determining which practices and obligations the parties
involved in a merger should take, (ii) the manner the practices are applied, (iii) the
monitoring and (iv) fulfilment of remedies. Establishing a remedy often regards only
determining practices and obligations; however, this Guide highlights the need for
effective remedies that comprise all mentioned aspects, which shall, in fact, mitigate
competition concerns derived by the mergers submitted to CADE.
Remedies may comprise the sale of tangible and intangible assets and/or
business units of the applicants, in addition to imposing behavioural obligations to their
businesses. The remedies shall aim at eliminating the potential harmful effects of a
transaction. Thus, the establishment of remedies is subject to the specificities of the
concrete case and the circumstances of the transaction, and must consider the potential
competitive harm observed on the review of the merger.
1.2 Legal basis
Article 9, Items 5 and 10, of Law 12529/2011, enforces that, amongst its
attributions, the Tribunal shall ratify the terms of Cease and Desist Agreements (TCC)
and Merger Control Agreements (ACC), ordering the Office of the Superintendent
General to monitor applicants' compliance with such agreements, and shall determine
merger control agreements whenever deemed timely and suitable.
According to article 61 of Law 12529/2011, in assessing the request for
clearance of a merger or acquisition, the Tribunal may refuse to process the case, clear
the transaction unconditionally, block it, or clear it subject to remedies, in which case
the Tribunal must specify the remedies to be fulfilled as a condition to the enforceability
and effectiveness of the transaction.
Additionally, Paragraph 2 of said Article defines that such remedies shall
comprise:
1. the sale of assets or a set of assets that constitute a business activity;
2. business division
3. disposal of controlling interest;
4. legal or accounting division of activities
5. compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights; and
6. any other practice or measure required to end harmful economic effects.
9As established by Article 165 of the Statutes of CADE, amongst other provisions,
CADE may receive proposals of Merger Control Agreements (ACC) in which remedies
are negotiated with the Applicants from the date of submission of the application for
merger review up to 30 days after the case has been challenged by the Office of the
Superintendent General to the Tribunal, without prejudice to the analysis on the merits of
the transaction.
On the other hand, Article 168 of CADE's Statutes mentions that in case of
mergers conditionally cleared, the Tribunal shall determine the remedies to be fulfilled
as a mean to ensure the enforceability and effectiveness of the transaction, as per article
61 of Law 12529/2011.
Besides, under the terms of Articles 36 and 38 of Law 12529/2011, remedies can
be applied in cases of economic crimes derived by anticompetitive practices.
1.3 Competition issues mitigated with antitrust remedies
This section briefly summarizes the main types of competitive issues derived by
mergers and acquisitions.
Both horizontal or vertical mergers may be harmful to competition by changing
incentives in specific markets and setting conditions to the applicants directly involved
in the merger to exercise their market power (unilateral effect). Furthermore, mergers
can change the operation of the relevant market by increasing the likelihood of tacit or
explicit coordination amongst competitors (coordinated effect). Lastly, by creating or
strengthening upstream or downstream market dominance, vertical mergers may harm
competition by eliminating or excluding current or potential efficient competitors
(market foreclosure).
In all cases, remedies must mitigate the potential harm to the competitive
environment resulting from the transaction, restoring rivalry and entry conditions
existing in the pre-merger scenario. However, remedies are not intended to solve
existing competition issues that are not a consequence of a merger.
It is worth mentioning that a transaction's blockage is the most appropriate
decision if a remedy cannot be applied to mitigate the potential harm to the competitive
environment, as foreseen by Law 12529/2011. Hence, this Guide for Antitrust Remedies
consolidates and describes CADE's precedent for cases in which competition concerns
are found and can be solved within the context of a merger, and therefore the antitrust
remedies applied may be effective.
101.4 Types of remedies
There are different types of antitrust remedies that can be applied. In general,
they can be classified as structural or behavioural remedies. Structural remedies regard
complete divestiture of assets, whereas behavioural remedies regard commercial
activities without required divestiture of assets. Defining antitrust remedies that grant
enforceability and effectiveness to a merger may include more than one remedy and
more than one type of remedy1.
To illustrate, based on both CADE's precedent (under the terms of Article 61,
Paragraph 2 of Law 12529/2011) and international precedent, structural remedies
imposed include:
1. The sale of assets or a set of assets that constitute a business activity;
2. Business division;
3. Disposal of controlling interest or non-controlling interest;
4. Complete divestiture of intellectual property rights, including patent,
brands, amongst others.
Item 1 above comprises the sale of pre-existing business units operating solo and
the divestiture of a set of assets that become feasible business units, which can be
immediately managed by the buyer. Assets may have, in both cases, (a) proven capacity
to operate in a competitive manner in the relevant market under the new management;
and (b) ability to mitigate the harmful effects of the merger.
Consequently, the sale of assets usually must comprise tangible and intangible
assets required to remain the effective performance of the business unit, such as: labour;
production, distribution and sale of goods; intellectual property rights; supply and
distribution contracts; information system; research and development activities and
infrastructure; permit and authorisations from relevant government authorities; and any
other essential requirements to ensure the above mentioned (a) and (b) items. Additional
behavioural requirements may also be required, such as provisional agreements for the
supply of certain inputs and technical support to the buyer, to ensure the divestiture
effectiveness.
1 There are cases in which behavioural measures have been adopted to complement a structural remedy.
In the case involving firms Perdigão S/A and Sadia S/A (Merger No. 08012.004423/2009-18), the
Tribunal of CADE decided for the disposal of an asset package (brands and intellectual property, rights
and goods related to certain operating units and distribution centres). Besides, additional behavioural
measures have been adopted, such as the determination to not sign exclusivity agreements with points of
sale during the term of the agreement, suspension of use of the brands Perdigão and Batavo, amongst
others. See the public version of the case files of the Proceeding (pp. 3881–3895)

11In a supplementary and alternative manner, in some cases that a structural
remedy is ineffective or disproportionate, behavioural remedies may be defined. These
remedies include commercial, financial or economic obligations from the parties
involved in the merger, whether or not regarding assets directly impaired by them in the
relevant markets related to the transaction. In short, obligations comprise:
1. legal or accounting division of activities;
2. business transparency obligations with and for third parties in supply and
purchase of inputs and products;
3. non-discriminatory and/or competitively inappropriate behaviour to third
parties in supply and purchase activities, regarding parties related within the merger;
4. suspension or withdrawal of exclusivity clauses in matters of fact and
law, in business relation with parties related within the merger;
5. obligation to provide inputs or access to key assets to vertically related
competitors;
6. obligation to report the merger, even if not reportable under the turnover
criterion;
7. suspension of political or corporate law resulting from shares or
competitive effects derived by financial instruments;
8. constraint to the access and disclosure of relevant competitive
information amongst related parties of the applicants of the merger;
9. mandatory licensing of intellectual property, including brands.
1.5 Designing remedies under Merger Control Agreements
Under the terms of Article 165 of the Statutes of CADE, applicants may submit a
remedy proposal from the date of submission of the application for merger review up to
30 days after the case has been challenged by the Office of the Superintendent General,
under a Merger Control Agreement (ACC). The submission of remedies proposal does
not impair applicants from making later adjustments to the initial proposal.
In particular, according to the Statutes of CADE: "Article 165. CADE may
accept proposals of Merger Control Agreements from the date of submission of the
application for merger review up to 30 days after the case has been challenged by the
Office of the Superintendent General, without prejudice to the analysis on the merits of
the transaction." Accordingly, "2. Proposals of Merger Control Agreements are to be
submitted to the Tribunal for approval." and "3. Merger Control Agreements negotiated
with the Office of the Superintendent General must be submitted to the Tribunal for
approval along with the decision of the Office of the Superintendent General to direct
the case to the Tribunal." The proposals must contain required information to be
properly analysed, as foreseen in Paragraph 4, Article 165 of the Statutes of CADE.
12Observing the principle of proportionality, before defining remedies, the
authority shall present potential competition issues identified (even within a provisional
context), both when the case is at the Office of the Superintendent General and in the
discussion with the Rapporteur Commissioner, providing the parties opportunity to
submit further clarifications. At the Tribunal, the remedies negotiation must start with
the Rapporteur Commissioner, without prejudice to applicants submitting the
transaction to the other Commissioners at any time.
The assembled grounds obtained at the end of the discovery phase or submitted
for hearing regarding the extent and characteristics of the competitive harm of the
transaction with a causal link may require different remedies or additional remedies to
the ones proposed, even if the parties present a remedy applied before the opinion of the
SG or the decision of the Tribunal.
The signing of a Merger Control Agreement favours the proper appliance of an
antitrust remedy. The parties commitment to comply with the remedy reduces risks and
allows better focusing the remedy for a particular purpose. In addition, parties
commitment enables positive management of assets until divestiture, safeguarding the
divestiture value to the firm. The Merger Control Agreement (ACC) mitigate risks of
ineffectiveness and judicialization of the remedy for both the antitrust authority and the
parties2.
As to confidentiality, in cases of both ACC and remedies unilaterally imposed by
CADE, some commercially sensitive aspects or aspects sensitive for the effectiveness of
a remedy, may be considered as of restricted access to CADE and the applicants; thus,
public and private versions of decisive documents are provided following the Statutes of
CADE.
2 Determinations to protect the asset package are common in CADE's decisions while the divestment
process is in progress. See Merger Novartis AG/Alcon Inc. (Merger No. 08012.003521/2008-57) that
established the transfer of rights, titles and assets of the medication Zaditen Eye Drops held by Novartis for
an economic agent that already holds production units operating in the pharmaceutical industry or for a new
entrant. In this case, the measures adopted in the agreement to protect assets and assure the effectiveness of
the divestiture were held in secrecy. See the public version of the case files of the Proceeding (pp. 410–413)

132 Principles and general guidelines for effective remedies
Effective remedies are remedies that surely solve competitive issues resulting
from a merger. This section describes the main principles that contribute for the
effectiveness of antitrust remedies and that should be considered during negotiation of
Merger Control Agreements, which are: proportionality, timeliness, feasibility and
verifiability.
2.1 Principles
2.1.1 Proportionality
An antitrust remedy should be proportional by determining required, adequate
and sufficient mitigating actions to revert competitive damages derived by a merger.
The proportionality requires at first that the applied remedies should independently be
able to mitigate the competition issues identified. On the other hand, it implies avoiding
the adoption of remedies exceeding the necessary to restore market competition.
Proportionality aims to maintain potential synergy amongst the applicants, as long as
ensuring that the potential harm to competition derived by the transaction is eliminated.
2.1.2 Timeliness
On the principle of timeliness, a remedy that mitigates competition issues more
quickly is preferable to a remedy whose effects takes longer. The longer the remedy's
term, the greater are the monitoring costs and the more susceptible remedy effectiveness
is to future events.
The definition of a reasonable term must take into account the characteristics of
the specific case. Long term remedies enforcement regarding the sale of assets or
businesses may impose burdens and costs to the applicants, considering, for instance,
the consummation of the transaction conditioned to the fulfilment of the divestiture
obligations. As to the antitrust authority, it results in higher monitoring costs, and it may
affect society since the anticompetitive effects observed are not actually mitigated
without the complete enforcement of the remedy. On the other hand, in cases of
remedies regarding firms' behaviour, the extension of remedies must be sufficiently long
to revert the negative effects of the transaction.
142.1.3 Feasibility
A remedy will only be effective if feasible in its different steps. The structural
remedy, for instance, must be defined so that the assets to be sold change controllers
without loss of competitive effect and can act as a real competitor in the relevant
market(s) adversely affected by the transaction. The remedy shall be monitored, present
actual means of resolution of incidents, and provide assurance on the mechanisms of
compliance over time. Remedies that cannot be monitored during the regular course of
the businesses or government activities, raise concerns that can be settled only at
significant costs, raise doubts on responsibilities, or provide a great risk of not being
fulfilled cannot be considered feasible.
The risks associated with the design, appliance and monitoring of remedies
regard, for instance, the absence of buyers for assets or non-controlling interests, the
insufficiency of assets effectively competing after disposal, the possibility of omission
or circumvention of monitoring or distortion of the required terms for compliance with
the restriction, and regulatory impediments to fully comply with the remedy.
2.1.4 Verifiability
The proposed remedies must be verifiable. The verifiability regards (i) means to
ascertain obligations; (ii) feasibility of monitoring the actions taken by the applicants
efficiently and effectively; (iii) check consequences, if necessary; and (iv) identifying the
subjects of the actions necessary to achieve the agreed or imposed remedies. The design
of a verifiable remedy reduces implementation risks and facilitates the pursuit of
compliance through appropriate judicial means in the event of non-compliance.
2.2 General guidelines
CADE's experience and international best practices allow us to assess, at first,
which remedies have greater or lesser adherence to the above principles, within the
corresponding context. This section presents general guidelines for effective remedies
that may guide and delineate Merger Control Agreements negotiations. We reinforce
these are overall guidelines, and their suitability shall be estimated considering the
specificities of the case under analysis.
2.2.1 Structural relief is preferred
Structural remedies must be prioritized, since the source of competition issues
derive from the change in the structure of a relevant market,
15in horizontal and vertical mergers. Thus, a structural remedy, such as divestiture, is
usually more effective as it drives the cause of the competitive harm more directly.
Besides, structural remedies provide less monitoring costs and fewer risks of market
distortions due to the remedies imposed in the transaction.
The adoption of structural remedies regard the transfer of property rights. This
transfer results in significant incentive change as to asset management since it implies a
new owner. By segmenting the ownership into two shares, the incentives to coordinate
decisions as to the use of these assets are substantially reduced, which increases
competition in the market.
In contrast, since in behavioural remedies assets ownership does not change,
initially there are no changes on the owner's incentives. The antitrust authority
establishes economic measures to the asset owner, which possibly would not be adopted
in the absence of such intervention. Consequently, moral hazard issues may arise, which
may compromise the effectiveness of this type of remedy.
2.2.2 Monitoring trustees are preferred
Given that CADE is unable to be directly and continuously involved in the
monitoring of the commitments execution regarded with the antitrust remedies, a
monitoring trustee is desirable to assist the agency in monitoring and ensuring the
fulfilment of the obligations established in the Merger Control Agreement.
Defining a monitoring trustee favours a timely identification of the applicants'
potential non-compliance with the duties and obligations and the corresponding
adoption of appropriate measures by the agency, increasing the likelihood of remedies
effectiveness. The range of the monitoring trustee's operation relies on the obligations
and measures defined in the Merger Control Agreement.
See further information on Section 5.1.1.
2.2.3 On the need for continuous monitoring
Remedies must be addressed at correcting anticompetitive effects of a given
transaction and therefore must be subject to lasting changes in the market structure.
However, at first, the market behaviour of applicants shall not be subject to extensive
monitoring by CADE, taking into consideration the monitoring costs involved.
16Concerning behavioural remedies specifically, the agency may impose
obligations to applicants regarding how they conduct businesses. To prevent
competition harms on a permanent basis, however, behaviours must have a lasting and
sustainable impact on market conditions. These long-term effects must be a result of
strict compliance with the behavioural requirements defined in the Merger Control
Agreement.
Behavioural remedies can be aimed at the internal operation of a business and/or
affect the relationship of the business with customers and competitors. In general, the
behavioural remedies that aim at changing the incentive structure of market players in a
pro-competitive way (by improving information exchange with customers, for instance)
are more effective than results control, i.e., the control over prices, service level
agreements and supply commitments. Hence, effective behavioural remedies imply on
viable monitoring, supervision and enforcement. However, it is worth mentioning that
besides the monitoring implying costs to CADE, it imposes costs to the applicants as to
information gathering, processing and submission to the agency. Thus, amongst other
reasons, remedies must be provisional but provide long-term effects.
2.2.4 Remedies to be approached with caution
Remedies that limit the autonomy of enterprises to lead their businesses
decisions may result in the enterprises operating contrary to their incentives, which
requires continuous monitoring of the established commitments by the antitrust
authority. Therefore, if some remedies are applicable due to proportional and reasonable
matters, they must be applied with great caution, such as market access and sales
restrictions.
Similarly, remedies that concern organizational commitments must be assessed
with caution, for instance: (i) legal separation within a business group; (ii) obligation
whether to make or not certain investments; (iii) long-term supply obligation; (iv)
obligations not to exercise certain shareholder rights. Such commitments may change
the incentive mechanisms of an enterprise, competitively impairing the business.
Although, they can be useful in specific cases, especially as additional remedies.
Moreover, price caps (the fixing of a maximum price for a given period) are not
acceptable remedies because, in addition to requiring continuous monitoring, in
practice, they do not represent effective measures aimed at negative impacts on market
conditions in the context of a merger. As a consequence, price caps are measures likely
to result in undesired distortions to economic incentives since limiting
17prices can constrain the entry of new competitors in the market, which impairs the level
of diversity and/or offered amount.
Concerning obligations to make investments, such measures aim to mitigate the
risk of capacity reduction after the merger. Yet, by imposing a capacity increase, this
type of remedy may act as a disincentive to efficient mergers once remedies that go
beyond their purpose of fighting competition issues often take over part of the
efficiencies resulting from a merger.
These measures can be defined, in most cases, as of broad scope, i.e., when they
do not have a strict causal link with potential competitive harm deriving from the
merger. An example would be the imposition of Research and Development (R&D)
investments to overcome Brazilian deficiency in technological development, which
surpass the foremost objectives of operation of an antitrust authority.
Conversely, obligations to not make investments, i.e., restrictive measures to
increase capacity, can reduce the risk of predatory behaviour by the merged firm.
However, it is likely to occur the limiting of the firm's development, in addition to supply
reduction.
183 Structural Remedies
Designing a structural remedy firstly consists of delimiting the assets to be
divested, which involves listing the assets and determining its capacity to generate
businesses, such as the amount of income or other auditable indicators and
considerations.
These assets must be able to exercise an effective competitive pressure to
overturn the negative effects of the transaction in the relevant market(s) affected. The
assets can be
(i) already operating individual business units or, if not possible, (ii) part of existing
business units to be partitioned to form a valid and active business entity after the sale.
Technological, productive, commercial or financial matters specific for the case
under review may justify that the scope of the assets to be divested includes business
units outside the relevant market negatively affected by the transaction or assets not
directly affected by the transaction. This may occur when the necessary assets to meet
the needs of the negatively affected relevant market do not reach a minimum scale to an
efficient remedy, which may occur when there is technological limitation to separate the
production involved in a remedy and when there is a small impact on the transaction's
efficiencies, amongst other possible cases.
Once defined the scope of the assets, they must be kept separate and operating in
the best way possible until the complete divestiture, with the ability to add value and
meet clients’ needs fully. That comprises applicants efforts to keep labour and sales
force mobilized, keep supply contracts and distribution channels active, etc. CADE may
appoint a trustee (see Section 5) upon indication of the applicants, who shall manage the
business until its sale, in cases the sale occurs after the Tribunal's hearing.
The showing of a buyer for the assets can occur at the submission of the case to
CADE, during the discovery phase or after the hearing of the case. During the period
established for divestiture, applicants must make the necessary efforts to sell the assets.
This pre-defined term must be short so as not to degrade assets and mitigate the
competition harm of the transaction.
The following sections present guidelines on asset package, selecting a buyer
and the divestiture process itself. The subsections present the classification of different
structural divestments, as well as guidelines to possibly sensitive issues as to defining
the remedy type and assets; the detailed process of selecting a buyer; and the divestiture
process itself in addition to the terms for divestment.
193.1 Asset Package
3.1.1 Defining asset packages
As a rule, the asset package must comprise the smallest business unit of a
business that includes all operations pertaining to the market at issue and that can
effectively compete independently.
In other words, the asset package part of a divestiture remedy must be sufficient
for the buyer to become an effective competitor in the relevant market. Thus, the
seller(s) must make available a package with all necessary assets (tangible and/or
intangible) so that the buyer becomes a de facto, long-term and permanent competitor.
The asset package must be described as clearly and precisely as possible. The
description shall comprise all items part of the package, such as tangible assets,
intangible assets, permits and authorizations required for the business, supply contracts,
lease contracts, amongst others. Such items are further detailed in the following Section
"Best practices and precautions to be followed in the definition of asset packages."
Subsequently, examples of usual remedies applied to mergers are briefly listed.
3.1.1.1 Viable autonomous business
A viable autonomous business functions regardless of transactions/relationships
with the divesting party, i.e., regardless of supply inputs, technical assistance or other
means of cooperation from the divesting party, although transitional agreements may be
required.
The viable autonomous business regards a divestiture package provided with all
necessary resources – e.g., physical assets, personal assets, client base, information
systems, intangible assets (intellectual property rights), and infrastructure management –
to compete effectively with applicants. Thus, the divestiture shall be a viable and
marketable business that represents a sustainable value.
A pre-existing business provides customers and potential customers a background
to assess whether the business unit will continue to be a reliable supplier for the relevant
product. Consequently, the background of a pre-existing business stipulates an
assumption that the business can become a viable competitor in a given market.
On the other hand, the optimal firm size matter deriving from the intervention
shall be taken into consideration, that is, the divestment and the applicants' remaining
business. To ensure that a given divestiture is attractive to potential buyers, it may be
necessary to consider beyond the set of assets required to compensate for the observed
competition issues. Such a hypothesis shall be assessed in a case-by-case manner to
ensure remedy proportionality and hinder opportunistic behaviour from possible parties
interested in the divestiture.
203.1.1.2 Carving-out: divestiture of a business unit part of a larger structure
In the case of a carving-out, the package to be divested consist of a business unit
to be separated, i.e., "carved" and partitioned from a larger firm structure. Subsidiary,
points of sale and production plants are some common examples.
The business to be divested, subject of a carve-out, must fulfil some
requirements so that the firm remains competitive on a continuous basis. Assets subject
to carve-out must be explicitly separated from the other assets, which implies in legal
and physical separation. Thus, it is required a separate organizational structure with the
ability to operate on its own regardless of applicants.
In this type of divestiture, the applicants and the divested business cease to
operate in an integrated manner. Temporary shifts and supply agreements can be
necessary and suitable while assets are integrated with the buyer. However, for carve-
out divestitures, it is not suitable that business units overlap with one another and
require continued cooperation from applicants for its functioning.
In some cases, a carve-out may not be a sufficient remedy. For instance, the loyalty
of important customers may be affected when a divestiture involves sales activities without
the transfer of the corresponding productive capacity. In such case, customers are likely to
oppose the seller, that is, to the applicant divesting the business. Therefore, the transfer of
market shares does not occur without the simultaneous transfer of production and
distribution.
The carve-out process to be held by the applicants requires oversight by the
monitoring trustee in cooperation with the hold-separate trustee (see Section 5 -
Trustees). The assets and part of the personnel that are shared between the business to
be divested and the remaining businesses of the parties must be allocated in a way that
ensures the viability and competitiveness of the divestiture. The allocation of assets and
personnel will be monitored and must be approved by the monitoring trustee.
Additionally, the carve-out process may require duplicate assets and personnel as
a way to ensure the viability and competitiveness of the divestiture. To illustrate, the
shares of the business to be divested in an IT core network pertaining to the parties may
require the installation of a different IT system.
In sum, the key actions to be adopted in a carve-out varies on a case-by-case
basis, which includes the possibility of duplicating assets and functions. Concurrently,
the parties shall provide the assets and services necessary for the feasibility of the
divestiture until it can operate on a stand-alone basis.
213.1.1.3 Mix-and-match: divestiture of a package combining assets of more than one of
the parties involved
Mix-and-match remedies combine assets of the parties involved in a merger
without pre-existing mutual coordination. Mix-and-match divestitures may raise
concerns on their viability and competitiveness as they do not provide certainty
regarding: (i) whether the previous separate parties will be able to operate jointly in an
effective manner; (ii) whether the parties can be promptly integrated after the remedy
(divestiture); and (iii) whether the new business unit will be able to operate effectively.
However, such concerns do not imply that this type of remedy is not suitable for
specific cases. In certain cases, the remedy can be necessary to ensure that the buyer of
the divestiture has the adequate assets to continue to compete effectively. In such cases,
to mitigate risks related to mix-and-match remedies, the antitrust authority may consult
suppliers, customers, competitors and potential buyers to observe the feasibility of the
package and whether the package will provide the buyer with the effective competition.
3.1.1.4 Divestiture or granting of an exclusive license for a long or indefinite term or until
the expiration of the term of patent
In particular cases, the divestiture of specific assets (such as a patent or a granted
license) may be a suitable remedy. Under certain circumstances, the granting of an
exclusive, irrevocable and unlimited license is acceptable, as long as the license is in
fact sufficient to transfer the market position. However, the preference is usually for the
divestiture of an asset package or a business unit, as they involve levels of uncertainty
and lower risks related to the possible transfer of market position on a permanent basis.
3.1.2 Best practices and precautions to be followed in the definition of asset packages
3.1.2.1 Completeness
A Merger Control Agreement must be complete, i.e., it must comprise all assets
necessary to the remedy effectiveness. To illustrate, it is important to have reference to
key personnel transfers or to key contracts with third parties, which can be significant
aspects for the success of a new player in certain relevant markets.
In some cases, the divestiture package must expect the transfer of contractual
relationships, such as agreements of long-term purchases, exclusive contracts for
rendering services or the supply of goods and services - for both the upstream and
downstream markets.
22The competitiveness of the business to be acquired can be severely undermined
if the contractual relationships are not transferred along with the divestiture and remain
with the applicants. In such a case, the market position would not be successfully
transferred to the buyer.
Similarly, lease contracts related to production plants, points of sale and logistic
facilities require applicants' best efforts to obtain consent from the other contracting
party (lessor) regarding the substitution of the applicant by the buyer of the divestiture
in the lease contract. Thus, the applicant must ensure that the lease contract is promptly
transferred and within the term of the divestiture.
3.1.2.2 Need for detailed definition of assets: tangible assets, intangible assets,
authorisations, personnel, documents, contracts, brands and licences
The Merger Control Agreement shall clearly detail all the assets involved in the
divestiture package, such as the following:
All significant tangible assets (e.g. production facilities; points of sale; logistic
facilities; storage facilities, which includes inventories and stocks; IT and R&D
facilities; amongst others.)
All significant intangible assets (e.g. patents; brands; licences; amongst others.)
Markets in which brands play a significant role, such as the market of consumer goods,
often need to include rights to use consolidated brands in the divestiture package.
Correspondingly, licences relating to patents or other industrial property rights or the
transfer of know-how, as a rule, must be exclusive so that the licensor's market position
is transferred to the licensee. It is not required for the licence to have worldwide
coverage regularly. The licence must cover the locations in which the business activities
are significant, as the geographic markets defined in the merger.
All authorizations and permits required for the independent and permanent
function of the business subject to divestiture (e.g. operating licences, official
certifications, quality certifications, certification marks, amongst others.)
Key personnel: staff and managers who are part of the divested business or are
required on a permanent and independent basis as they have contact with key customers
and suppliers or have specific skills and know-how related to R&D, IT, production and
logistics that are relevant for the business competitiveness subject to the divestment.
The buyer must be allowed to sign employment contracts in place of the applicants.
23All relevant documents and records related to the business subject to the
divestment.
All required contracts for the functioning of the business subject to the
divestment (e.g. contracts with suppliers and customers, as well as lease contracts.) The
buyer must be allowed to enter into existing contractual relationships in place of the
applicants.
3.1.2.3 Possibility of involving assets of other relevant markets
In addition to the firm or business unit to be divested, in specific cases the
divestiture package must include specific human resources or assets to ensure the
competitiveness and economic viability of the divestiture:
Activities in close geographic or product markets or close facilities that, if
available and combined with the business to be divested, make the divestiture
economically feasible.
Specific functions, such as key functions that a buyer cannot substitute
immediately, particularly in cases that a firm part of a business group provides specific
services to all the firms of the group.
Additional business units that are not related directly to the competition issues
derived by the transaction but have to be included to ensure that the divestiture package
is the best strategic fit for potential buyers. For instance, entering a certain market is
only efficient if there is a minimum scale of activities or a greater product portfolio.
3.1.2.4 Key personnel non-inducement clause
In some cases, it is required, at defining the asset package, contract clauses
regarding the obligation of non-inducement of personnel by the applicants. This is
applicable when the competitiveness of the divestiture is inherently related to the key
personnel as to their skills, expertise, credibility or relationship with customers.
If applicants attract the key personnel part of the business to be divested, an
essential part of the business is undermined since the competitive potential of the
divestiture can be transferred back to the applicants. Thus, it is required that, in some
cases, the applicants waive rights through non-compete clauses established in
employment contracts regarding their key personnel.
243.1.2.5 Market tests
Market tests mean an important source of information to review whether the
proposed remedies are sufficient, required and proportional to eliminate competition
concerns identified by CADE. Therefore, key customers, suppliers and competitors, as
well as interested third parties whose motion to intervene have been granted, are usually
questioned by CADE to provide the authority different perceptions as to the suitability
of the proposed remedies and their possible effects on the affected markets.
In sum, CADE send them a draft of the commitments proposed along with some
questions. The market tests also allow interested third parties – granted a motion to
intervene in the case – an opportunity to express themselves as to the consequences of
the proposed remedies in the market. Conversely, CADE will not hold market tests if
the commitments proposed are clearly unsuitable for eliminating competition concerns.
Depending on the circumstances of the case, market tests can address the
following issues or assist on answering them:
Whether the remedies package (or which package) would eliminate competition
concerns identified in the investigation.
Whether some potential risks or concerns can arise during remedies
enforcement.
Whether there are potential constraints to the efficiency of remedies.
As to the enforcement of structural remedies, particularly divestitures, the
following issues may be relevant:
Which requirements are necessary for the divestiture to ensure the effective
transfer of the market position to the buyer?
Which conditions should be fulfilled by the buyer to ensure their role as an
effective competitor?
Whether there are potential buyers interested in acquiring the business subject to
the divestment. Would potential buyers be able to enter into a competitive position in the
relevant markets based on the remedies package established or which conditions should
be fulfilled for such matter?
Market tests can be held at an early stage, within the pre-filing and before the
official submission (through waivers).
25In case the Office of the Superintendent General or the Tribunal consult market
players on the remedy efficiency, the confidentiality of the information and the
existence of negotiation and its terms shall be observed. The consultations must avoid
the sharing of competitively sensitive information of the applicants, as well as
information that may compromise the parties' ability to negotiate the assets to be
divested.
According to practice, whenever deemed suitable, interested third parties
consulted on certain remedies shall have up to 3 business days to give expression on the
matter.
The answers provided usually offer important information that can assist
CADE's investigation and serve as remarkably useful evidence to CADE's review.
However, it must be taken into consideration the quality and bases of the answers, as
well as that the answers express the respective economic interests of the consulted
agents. Therefore, the responses provided by the market players is non-binding to
CADE's investigation.
Lastly, to ascertain the real status of the assets involved in the remedies package
or other significant aspects for the specific case, CADE can request on-site visits to
production plants or logistics centre pertaining to the applicants or other players. In
general, the function of the facilities are explained on-site. Additionally, meetings with
potential buyers prior to defining the remedy to be adopted can be relevant in certain
cases.
3.1.2.6 Crown Jewels
In particular cases, when a potential buyer presents a high level of uncertainty
under CADE's perspective, the authority may establish the adoption of crown jewels. In
crown jewels, the divestiture package is broadened in relation to the markets considered
problematic in the merger, aiming at increasing the economic attractiveness of the
business to be divested.
Consequently, the divestiture process has two stages, i.e., the first divestiture is
substituted (or supplemented) by an alternative divestiture (or additional), which is
known as a crown jewel. This alternative divestiture occurs if observed that the first
divestiture will not take place within the established term.
A divestiture will be accepted as an alternative solution (crown jewel) in case the
existence of a suitable buyer is not evident to CADE, which means a sale without
difficulties, observing the principle of proportionality.
26As a rule, crown jewels must be more attractive than the first divestiture from
the perspective of both the potential buyer and the seller.
There are cases in which the divestiture through a crown jewel is a solution
when observed the buyer faces other difficulties, such as preferential rights of
shareholders in joint-venture agreements, intellectual property rights established in
licences, difficulties to sign contracts, amongst others.
The total term for divestiture should not be substantially longer than expected in
general in this guide, including both stages of the divestiture process. Otherwise, the
implementation of remedies is effective only at a later stage. A considerably extended
term for the adoption of crown jewel remedies could also put at risk the divestiture
itself, which would require additional measures to safeguard the economic viability and
competitiveness of the business.
On the other hand, an overly short term would favour interested third parties to
take advantage on the alternative business. Therefore, CADE must be attentive so that
buyers do not make use of crown jewels to obtain a divestiture package more valuable
than the necessary to address competition concerns derived by the transaction,
particularly in cases the number of potential buyers is low.
3.1.2.7 Further precautions in defining asset packages
Introducing structural divestiture remedies entails the difficulties of making an
asset package that turns the buyer into an effective competitor, with all resources and
expertise required by the market at issue.
Thus, in defining the asset package, the competition authority must watch out for
applicants' cherry-picking behaviour (that is, selecting the assets whose sale is most
beneficial to them) whenever this behaviour hinders the success of the remedy in
solving the competitive harm.
The divestiture is also subject to an empty shell problem, i.e. a hollow divestiture
package. This may occur where the human resources of a divestiture package are
difficult to identify or transfer, whether because of unwilling employees or issues with
the labour legislation.
A divestiture package whose assets did not use to operate independently before
the remedy is also more prone to be insufficient and to bring about problems in its
implementation. Mix-and-match remedies, for instance, which combine the assets of
several merging companies, risk failure due to the huge information gap between the
seller and the buyer. The seller has an incentive not to incorporate the right assets into
the package; the competition authority, for its part, may not have enough information to
27verify whether the package is appropriate.
On the other hand, an independent and viable business is not always the best
divestiture solution. Even though a remedy would run the risk of being insufficient, if
the buyer already holds some of the assets required to operate the business, making a
divestiture package of just a few assets could be more appropriate. Thus, incorporating
these assets in the divestiture package may render the purchase inefficient, as the buyer
is compelled to buy assets it would not need for efficiently competing in the relevant
market. Moreover, requiring the entire business to be sold could be disproportionate to
the competitive harm, excessively restricting the potential efficiencies of the transaction.
The competition authority should also avoid maintaining existing vertical
dependency relationships in the upstream and downstream markets (e.g. the provision of
raw materials or technical support). In these cases, the remedy generally fails to restore
competition, whether because the buyer struggles to operate properly (as it is dependent
on the supply and/or support provided by the seller) or because the buyer and the seller
start to coordinate their behaviour.
3.1.3 Hold-separate and ring-fencing obligations
It is important to avoid the assets deteriorate before the divestiture is completed,
and thus divestiture remedies should include obligations to prevent this from happening.
Such obligations might comprise (i) maintaining the business and avoiding the adoption
of measures that would have relevant negative effects on its value, management, and
competitiveness; (ii) providing the financial resources necessary for continuing the
business; (iii) retaining the business' key personnel; amongst others.
In addition to steps to protect the divestiture package, there should be others
intended for separating the divested business from the business retained by the
applicants.
3.1.3.1 Appointment of a hold-separate trustee
Some cases require appointing a hold-separate trustee to preserve and separate
the divestiture package. This trustee is appointed by the parties and is responsible for
managing the business during its transfer, up to its closing. The trustee is responsible for
preserving the divested business and ensuring it is held separate from the business
retained by the parties, under the supervision of a monitoring trustee.
It is the hold-separate trustee's duty to make sure the divested assets are
independent and to promptly eliminate all the influence of the parties in the divested
business so as to preserve its viability, marketability, and competitiveness.
28For further information on the hold-separate trustee, see Section 5.1.2.
3.1.3.2 Ring-fencing: preventing information sharing between the divested business
and the seller
Another means to separate business information is establishing a ring fence
between the transferrer and the divested business.
It is important to ensure the key personnel of the merged company (seller) has no
access to the divested business, and vice versa. The exchange of information between
the divested business and the seller must be avoided.
In this regard, the parties must take all the steps necessary to make certain they
will not find out trade secrets or other confidential information from the divested
business. Any confidential documents and information related to the divested business
received from the parties before the ring fence is set should be returned to the divested
business or destroyed.
Theoretically, a ring fence is more easily created when the divested business is
already an independent, standalone enterprise with a distinct management from the
seller. However, there is a significant problem of information asymmetry in ring-
fencing, which makes it particularly hard for CADE to monitor this kind of obligation.
3.1.3.3 Trademark maintenance commitment
Although trademarks are part of intellectual property, its characteristics and
functions are very different from those of patents and industrial designs. Basically,
trademarks are distinctive signs whose main function is differentiating competitors in a
market. In addition to protecting the identity of manufacturers, vendors, and service
providers, trademarks reduce transaction costs, since they help consumers find their
desired product.3
When a remedy entails the right to use a consolidated brand in the asset package,
the authority must protect this asset whilst the divestiture is not completed. In this
regard, CADE's decisions usually require the business to continue normally until the
divestiture is closed. A way to maintain trademark value whilst the divestiture has not
been completed is keeping the trademark's level of marketing investment.
3 With the exception of geographical indications, intellectual property is protected for a limited period of
time. Trademarks have a ten-year term, extended for equal and successive periods under Article 133 of
Law 9279/1996.
293.2 The buyer
Regarding structural remedies, a buyer must be, in principle, an economic entity
unrelated to the parties' business structure. Additionally, buyers must prove to CADE
their capacity and interest to keep the assets fully operational and competing in the
relevant market.
A competent buyer with the potential to enter the relevant market is more likely
to solve competition concerns arising from a transaction than a buyer that already
operates in that market, as the remedy may create or strengthen pre-existing dominant
positions. Larger players, with more financial power, are more likely to make a
competition concern arise again. This is the case when the buyer is already a strong
player in the relevant market or when it is a significant supplier or customer, potentially
leading to market foreclosure.
However, it is possible that a buyer that already operates in the market mitigates
the concern, considering its expertise and experience. In any case, applicants must have
the buyer approved by CADE. Proposing CADE a buyer when filing the remedy
proposal reduces the time needed to consummate the first transaction.
3.2.1 Selection4
The act of proposing a buyer can take place at different times. In a fix-it-first
remedy, the buyer is selected before merger clearance, and the asset package is made
specifically for the chosen buyer. In an upfront buyer remedy, the consummation of the
transaction is conditional on choosing the buyer, which occurs after merger clearance.
In a post-consummation remedy, the buyer is selected after the transaction is
consummated — that is, the transaction may be consummated immediately after
clearance.
The table below sums ups these three cases, and the following sections detail
each of them.
4 Competition authorities around the world, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the
European Commission, have different understandings regarding the fix-it-first, upfront buyer, and post-
consummation approaches.

Note: in a fix-it-first, the divestiture may also be consummated before signing
the Merger Control Agreement. See section 3.3.1 "Deadlines for divestiture" for
deadlines for defining a buyer.
3.2.1.1 Fix-it-first remedy5
In a fix-it-first solution, the choosing of a buyer for the asset package and the
signing of a binding agreement happen before merger clearance. A fix-it-first remedy is
appropriate in cases where the parties offer recovery structural measures during merger
review. The parties indicate a buyer for the assets to be divested and enter into a binding
agreement during merger review. In case CADE clears the transaction — meaning the
5 Some jurisdictions define a fix-it-first remedy as selling the divestiture to a buyer appointed by the
applicants, forgoing the execution of a Merger Control Agreement (ICN, 2016 — Merger Remedies Guide,
p. 16). In Brazil, only in specific cases can a fix-it-first remedy solve the competitive harm without a
Merger Control Agreement.
31buyer has also been approved — the divestiture process can be carried out as soon as the
transaction is cleared.
A fix-it-first remedy is implemented when the identity of the buyer is crucial for
the effectiveness of the proposed remedy; in such cases, very few buyers can be
considered suitable. It happens where (i) the divestiture is not a viable business by itself,
depending on a buyer's specific assets to achieve viability; or (ii) the buyer needs to
have specific features for the remedy to solve competition concerns raised by the
transaction.
One of this remedy's advantages is having an asset package tailored to the
identified buyer. Hence, the package can be more modest than one that needs suit any
buyer, as is the case with upfront buyer or post-consummation remedies. Moreover, a
fix-it-first remedy allows consummation immediately after merger clearance.
This relief is also recommended where assets can lose value between the signing
of a Merger Control Agreement and the conclusion of a divestiture process. For
instance, where (i) the key personnel and/or clients of the divested business may be lost;
or (ii) it is difficult to conduct a carve-out process in the meantime, since it depends on
entering into a binding agreement with the buyer.
3.2.1.2 Upfront buyer remedy
Some cases demand an upfront buyer for CADE to be sure the business will be
transferred to an appropriate buyer. In such instances, as a condition for the
consummation of the transaction, the parties must undertake to sign a binding agreement
with a CADE-approved buyer. Unlike the fix-it-first relief, in this remedy the buyer is
only appointed after merger clearance. Thus, the asset package tends to be larger than in
a fix-it-first remedy, since it should suffice to turn any buyer (irrespective of its identity)
into an effective competitor.
This solution is recommended where there are relevant obstacles to a divestiture,
such as third parties' rights or uncertainties about whether an appropriate buyer can be
found. In such cases, an upfront buyer allows CADE to be sufficiently certain the
commitments will be fulfilled, as the buyer is appointed before consummation.
An upfront buyer is also preferable to a post-consummation solution where risks
of asset depreciation are high. This is because in the time between signing a Merger
Control Agreement and transferring the asset, the signatory (applicant) has significant
incentives to stop investing and operating the asset. Hence, an upfront buyer ensures the
signatory keeps the facilities, machinery, and its units' equipment in a perfect state of
repair, and that its personnel is ready to operate without interruptions.
32Implementing this remedy may be beneficial to the applicants, since it expedites
the divestiture process; increases the certainty of having a viable divestiture (more than
the conventional decision to look for a buyer only after the transaction is completed);
and avoids a sale in which the parties have to divest larger asset packages (e.g. crown
jewels). In addition, it helps the authority, as it is more certain that the divestiture will
bring about competitive effects.
3.2.1.3 Post-consummation remedy
In a post-consummation remedy, a buyer must be selected and a binding
agreement must be signed by a certain deadline after merger clearance. This relief is
appropriate in most cases in which, due to an uncomplicated divestiture, it is easy to
find severable potential buyers. Where buyers are demanded specific qualifications, the
remedy can still be applied if enough potential buyers hold these qualifications.
At the same time, CADE must be sufficiently confident the asset package will be
able to attract suitable buyers and that the assets will not depreciate by the time the sale
is concluded. As with an upfront buyer remedy, some measures must be taken to
preserve the asset package until the divestiture process ends. This type of relief usually
involves more risks in its implementation than fix-it-first or upfront buyer solutions.
3.2.2 Requirements
3.2.2.1 Independence from merging firms
From a competition standpoint, an appropriate buyer should have economic
incentives to operate the divested business as a competitor of the applicants and of other
players of its market. This means the buyer must be independent from the applicants and
their affiliate companies, which entails being independent from (i) any equity interest —
including minority stakes — and (ii) management connections (e.g. where a CEO or
managing director of one of the buyer's affiliates participates in the applicant's board of
directors).
Owning a minority stake in a connected company frequently opens up the
possibility of influencing the company's competitive behaviour. Where a buyer holds
equity interest in companies belonging to the applicants' business group, this buyer is
less inclined to compete with the applicants if the divested business operates in the same
market than the applicants or in upstream or downstream markets.
Similarly, having a contractual relationship with the applicants in the markets
33affected by the transaction may call into question the independence of the buyer and the
remedy's competitive effects. This may be the case for financially relevant supply
agreements, as well as for cooperation agreements in the markets affected by the
transaction or in geographic or product markets close to the affected markets.
Finally, the price paid for the assets may be used to indicate how much
independence from the applicants a buyer has. This price can help proving fraud, as if
the asset is sold at an unreasonably low price, it may suggest the buyer has no interest in
applying the acquired asset to compete in that market.
3.2.2.2 Avoiding new competition concerns
A buyer must prepare a convincing business plan detailing how it will operate
the divestiture so as to fully develop its competitive potential, specifically mentioning
the markets where competition concerns had been raised. Otherwise, the buyer's
business may raise new competition concerns, such as in the following instances:
• The buyer plans to employ its acquired business for activities that differ
from its current activities. e.g. operating in different markets.
• The acquired divestiture will be resold to a third party in the near future.
• The buyer has incentives to transfer the acquired business.
• Loans granted by the asset seller can reduce the buyer's business risks and
may lead to a situation in which the acquired business becomes dependant on the
creditor (i.e. one of the applicants). By receiving a loan from one of the applicants, the
buyer may indicate lack of interest in using the acquired business to compete with the
applicants, or that it will not make use of its full competitive potential.
3.2.2.3 Incentive/capacity to maintain and develop the divested business
The intended effects of a divestiture will only be reached if the business is
transferred to a buyer capable of making it effectively competitive. To that end, the
buyer should have economic incentives and the capacity to maintain and develop the
divested business.
a) Financial health
A buyer must demonstrate it has the financial resources required to develop the
business in a competitive way.
In case the applicant (transferrer) is responsible for the funds needed to purchase
the assets, the transferrer will most likely have partial control over the assets and the
34buyer; it also implies the buyer has difficulties in acquiring a bank loan.
Hence, by receiving a loan from one of the applicants, the buyer may signal it
has no real interest to compete with the applicants and, consequently, it will not make
full use of the business' competitive potential.
b) Capacity to satisfy the regulatory requirements
An appointed buyer's acquisition of a divested business should neither raise new
competition concerns nor risk delaying the fulfilment of the established obligations.
Therefore, the buyer is expected to be capable of satisfying every regulatory
requirement to purchase the business.
c) Expertise
As the case may be, it is desirable a buyer has proven expertise in the relevant
market and enough experience and financial resources to successfully operate the
purchased business. This is the case for markets that require companies have specific
expertise or resources for successfully competing in it.
3.2.3 CADE Approval
A structural remedy requires a suitable buyer to be effective. As seen above,
divestiture remedies set criteria for potential buyers, e.g. independence from the
merging firms, not raising new competition concerns, financial health, etc.
Against this backdrop, regardless of the criteria applied in choosing a buyer and
the moment to do so — that is, through a fix-it-first, upfront buyer, or post-
consummation approach, depending on the transaction — the nominated buyer must be
approved by CADE before the business is sold. This is true for buyers selected by the
applicants or not.
As a rule, applicants are free to choose to whom they will sell, as long as they
meet the obligations set in the Merger Control Agreement, submit the appointed buyer
to CADE, and receive the authority's approval. However, there is also the possibility of
selling assets through processes such as auctions, public offerings, etc.
In the case of government procurement processes, specifically, it is worth noting
the players most likely to win are also those who can give raise to new competition
concerns. This is because, due to their market power, these players can present higher
turnovers in their proposals, whilst smaller players cannot. On the other hand, these
concerns can be avoided if the authority identifies these problems and restricts
35eligibility before the auction.
Thus, in approving a buyer, CADE must ensure all requirements provided by the
Merger Control Agreement are met, which applies both for where a buyer is selected by
the applicants as well as where the selection is carried out through the other processes.
3.3 The divestiture process
3.3.1 Timetable for the divestiture process
The divestiture must be accomplished within the shortest time frame possible;
our experience has it that it should take three to six months. During the time frame set
for divestiture, obligations can be fulfilled in parts, and failure to fulfil them may result
in penalties and the parties losing their ability to conduct the divestiture process as they
see fit. Where the time limit for divestiture has expired, except in the event technical
problems prevented compliance, a Merger Control Agreement must provide for
auctioning (rather than negotiating) the assets and the possibility of not having a reserve
price so as to ensure divestiture obligations are met. Failure to comply with divestiture
commitments leads to CADE blocking and undoing the transaction, regardless of any
provision in the Merger Control Agreement for any kind of integration between the
parties.
After the contract of sale is signed and the asset transfer is concluded6, the
parties must sever all ties with the divested assets, except for those indispensable to
preserve the remedy, such as authorisations and/or licenses; supply contracts;
distribution channels; or other contracts and relationships necessary for the divested
business' operations. In such exceptional instances, post-sale ties must be transparent, be
severed as soon as possible, and preserve the remedy's effects of mitigating the
anticompetitive harm of the transaction.
It is worth mentioning compliance with structural obligations may continue to be
monitored after the divestiture stage. The reason for it is that the sale, transfer of assets,
and contracts between customers/suppliers may not be enough to assure the buyer of the
viability of the business, especially when it comes to a new entrant in the market.
In this sense, maintaining the integrity and commercial viability of the assets
extends beyond the sale stage. The issues that could emerge after the asset transfer is
consolidated are more easily solved when parties are aware CADE is still overseeing the
divestiture process.
6 It is worth mentioning that signing a purchase and sale agreement does not necessarily mean the
divestiture is being implemented. The divestiture process entails not only this signature, but the actual
transfer of assets and contractual relationships (i.e. contracts with suppliers and clients, lease agreements,
use of distribution channels, etc.) and the transfer of authorisations and permits (e.g. a business licence)
required to operate the divested business.
363.3.2 Appointment of a divestiture trustee
Merger Control Agreements can provide for a divestiture trustee to carry out the
divestiture process where the Applicants fail to perform it by the set deadline. Thus, the
divestiture trustee is tasked with selling the business by a second deadline. In this case,
the divestiture trustee sells the divested assets for the best price possible, without being
limited by a reserve price or depending on the Applicants' instructions.
For further information on the divestiture trustee, see Section 5.1.3.
3.3.3 Pricing terms
In case the first deadline for divestiture has been missed, the divestiture may
occur without a reserve price. This minimises the risks involved in implementing the
divestiture process and increases the chances of finding an appropriate purchaser that, in
this case, will be assisted by a divestiture trustee.
CADE emphasises the agency does not take into account whether the sale will
be profitable for the signatory. It only ensures the criteria for purchasers set forth by the
Merger Control Agreement are met, so that the divestiture process achieves its main
goal: restoring competition.
As a consequence, CADE's clearance is not conditioned on the price paid by a
buyer. Nonetheless, prices paid in such purchases may be used to verify the possibility
of fraud, as excessively high or low prices may suggest the buyer has no interest in
employing the acquired assets to improve its competitiveness.
3.3.4 Due diligence
A divestiture process must ensure potential buyers can conduct due diligence
review and obtain, depending on the stage of the process, sufficient information on the
divestiture process so as to fully assess the value, scope, and commercial potential of a
business, in addition to have direct access to its personnel.
The trustee (or the parties) should grant potential buyers all documents and
information necessary for a thorough assessment of the divested business.
3.3.5 Approval process
The parties must have CADE's clearance as to the buyer and the purchase and
sale agreement. This requirement applies to all divestiture remedies, regardless of the
type. CADE must be informed of the buyer's identity and be provided the purchase and
sale agreement and all necessary information by the end of the divestiture deadline.
Furthermore, the agency requires a sufficient amount of time to ascertain the
37buyer and the purchase and sale agreement suit the requirements established by the
Merger Control Agreement. This assessment is conducted according to the documents
presented and to meetings with the potential buyer and the monitoring trustee. This does
not exempt firms from notifying the new transaction whenever it meets the criteria for
pre-merger mandatory notification.
384 Behavioural remedies
Where structural remedies fail to successfully address competition concerns or,
due to regulatory or factual matters, remedies are inefficient, CADE may impose
behavioural remedies to mitigate the transaction's anticompetitive harm if effective to
revert this harm. In addition, behavioural remedies can be used to complement and
increase the efficiency of structural remedies. With regard to the proportionality
principle, a behavioural remedy should be measured by its capacity to solve a
transaction's competition concerns, whether by itself or accompanied by structural
remedies.
Generally, behavioural remedies apply to vertical integrations, as they can better
preserve potential efficiencies (e.g. externalities, lower transaction costs) of a merger
whilst mitigating the risk of market foreclosure.
In considering structural remedies, the amount of assets transferred for a
successful remedy is proportional to the synergy between the assets — whilst being
careful not to lose the efficiencies of the divestiture package. Conversely, the more
assets transferred, the higher the chances of losing the efficiencies created by the
merger, as fewer assets will remain with the Applicant. In case a transaction leads to
vertical foreclosure, a divestiture package may be created, functioning as an
independent business with assets with two or more links in the production chain.
However, this may result in an exceedingly large divestiture package, which can
jeopardise the proportionality principle of the remedy.
When this happens, and the relationship between different links in a production
chain can potentially cause anticompetitive harm, one solution is to apply behavioural
remedies — which may or may not be added to the structural remedies.
The main behavioural remedies in vertical integrations are obligations to grant
access to fixed inputs (e.g. infrastructure with the characteristics of an essential facility)
or to intellectual property rights.
The success of such measures, especially in remedies that facilitate market
access, depend on the anticompetitive harm caused by the transaction. For instance, if it
entails the acquisition of a relevant market player, in the majority of cases the harm is
only offset through divestiture. Conversely, if a transaction mainly raises pre-existing
entry barriers — through vertical integration, for instance — measures to facilitate
market access are usually enough to offset anticompetitive effects.
With regard to intellectual property rights, the granting of licences may
constitute a suitable remedy where the effects of a merger only involve raising pre-
existing entry barriers. In cases like these, the licence should enable competitors enter
39the market or facilitate their entry to a degree that offsets the anticompetitive harm.
We should note that the process of granting a licence should be transparent and
non-discriminatory. If the licensor is a competitor, the terms of this licence should not
jeopardise the licensor's competitiveness. However, in considering the long contractual
relationship between competing firms in a licencing agreement, CADE can take into
account the possibility of future problems such as the need for negotiations on licence
fees, for instance, which can hinder the success of a remedy.
It is worth noting behavioural remedies entail more risks, as they take longer to
implement than structural ones. Unlike with structural remedies, CADE does not
suggest time limits for these, since they will depend on the specificities of each case. In
addition, the issue of asymmetry of information between CADE, the merging firms, and
third parties is more common with behavioural remedies.
The very nature of these remedies makes them more difficult to define and
assess and more expensive to the agency and parties. Behavioural remedies can also
create unwanted and unpredictable distortions in the affected markets. Lastly, they may
be ineffective as to competition, since they do not remove the incentives for Applicants'
abuse of dominant position. Thus, the competition authority needs to be cautious with
their design and, most importantly, their supervision.
Despite these risks, behavioural remedies at times are appropriate, since they can
address different kinds of competition concerns, especially where divestiture is
disproportional and/or may significantly compromise the efficiencies generated by the
transaction.
4.1 Precautions and best practices to be followed when designing behavioural remedies
As far as behavioural remedies go, we should note measures that directly control
the prices and quality of the products offered by the parties should be exceptional. These
costly measures run a substantial risk of being ineffective and constitute a regulation in
the strict sense. In the majority of cases, those not involved in the business and
operation of the business units lack information to make a proper assessment of these
competitive conditions.
On the other hand, the experience of CADE and other countries has it that
behavioural remedies — non-exclusivity and non-discrimination, for instance — are
common and suitable for mergers that raise vertical concerns such as those seen above.
This experience does not exclude the possibility of structural remedies, if the principles
of viability, proportionality, timeliness, and verifiability are properly addressed.
In a behavioural remedy related to vertical relationship of parties and third
40parties (such as non-discrimination or access to essential facilities), CADE usually does
not mediate any disputes that may rise between them. Nonetheless, the authority may
receive information on non-compliance with obligations to verify whether the remedies
have been properly performed.
As an example, in a vertical integration, Chinese walls are behavioural remedies
aimed at reducing the flow of information between the upstream and downstream
departments of a verticalised firm. When the flow of information between the
departments is stopped, upstream and downstream discrimination of competitors is less
likely to occur.
Whilst Chinese walls target the issue of exchange of sensitive information,
which can cause an Applicant's discrimination against its competitors, there is also a
problem in the information asymmetry between the Applicant and the competition
authority, which may jeopardise the monitoring of the remedies. As a result, remedies
such as Chinese walls are usually more effective as ancillary remedies.
Generally, it is advisable that a monitoring trustee participates in the design of
behavioural remedies to track, document, and report on compliance with the remedies to
the competition authority. Depending on the behavioural remedies adopted, the outcome
of independent audits may be included in the monitoring. CADE's experience suggests
there is little need for reports of limited or reasonable assurance prepared according to
the Brazilian Standards on Accounting (NBC TO 3000), Assurance Engagement Other
Than Audits or Reviews (approved by Resolution 1160/09 of the Brazilian Federal
Accounting Council). In this cases, the remedy must necessarily provide for, and
impose, a direct relationship between CADE and the independent auditor with no the
intervention by the signatories. The provision allows the independent auditor to provide
all the information CADE requires to make a critical assessment of whether the
obligations established in the remedies have been met. Moreover, it enables CADE to
change the way the monitoring is conducted dependent on the authority's assessment
and the provisions that were established7.
7 NBC TO 3000 clarifies the work plan of an independent auditor is an "ongoing, interactive process
developed throughout the engagement" (Paragraph 13) and that "if an independent auditor learns about an
issue that leads to questioning whether a relevant modification should be made in the object information,
the auditor must address the issue by carrying out enough procedures to allow including the issue in the
audit report" (Paragraph 37).
415 Trustees
Where necessary, CADE instructs the parties to hire trustee to take part in a
remedy's implementation and monitoring. Trustees report directly to CADE, according
to mandates established in a Merger Control Agreement or in a decision by CADE's
Tribunal. These trustees must know the business described in the remedy and are
compensated by the parties to the transaction, who may appoint them before the hearing.
5.1 Roles
5.1.1 Monitoring trustee
A monitoring trustee is tasked with supervising and ensuring remedy
implementation. Against this background, a monitoring trustee helps both the
competition authority and the Applicants in examining whether the obligations
established are met. The trustee is independent from the applicants, even though
compensated by them, and is responsible for ensuring the Applicants implement the
remedies thoroughly, effectively and without delay.
To this end, a monitoring trustee must point out potential obstacles in the way
and check the Applicants' success in planning , preparing and executing all intermediary
stages required. Trustees also verify whether applicants have been meeting their
obligations so as to not compromise the economic viability of the business set for
divestiture.
We must stress that, although monitoring trustees have an active role in
enforcing remedies, they cannot decide on behalf of CADE. They work under the
supervision of CADE through a mandate and regularly report to the authority about the
implementation of the planned measures and fulfilment of the remedy obligations.
Concurrently, Applicants must give a mandate to the trustee, with powers sufficiently
broad to effectively monitor the agreement.
Following the end of a trustee's mandate, established in a Merger Control
Agreement or a decision by CADE, he or she sends CADE and the Applicants a final
report and ensure potential business secrets from one Applicant have not been not
disclosed to the other.
In general, the structural or behavioural obligations set forth in a Merger Control
Agreement will guide the tasks of the monitoring trustee.
The mandate signed by the Applicants and trustee specifies the trustee's
obligations and responsibilities, whilst the work plan further details the trustee's duties.
In summary, the main duties of a monitoring trustee, depending on the case, are
42the following:
 Ensure the behavioural obligations are met, monitoring the performance of
the firm's daily obligations and of its relationship with customers, suppliers,
and other third parties that may be affected by the obligations negotiated
with CADE. Trustees should have free access to the firm, documents,
systems, and other assets entailed in properly monitoring the obligations;
moreover, dependent on the mandate given by CADE, they may suggest
corrections in order to ensure the obligations are fulfilled.
 Trustees supervise safeguard measures related to the divested business
from the moment the Merger Control Agreement is signed to the completion
of the divestiture process. During this time frame, trustees are responsible
for supervising the management and preservation of the assets as a
separate business (preservation monitoring trustee).
 In case of an asset carve-out, trustees are responsible for monitoring the
splitting of the assets of the divested business from those of the businesses
retained by the parties; personnel reallocation; and, if need be, duplication of
assets and duties previously retained by the Applicants (carve-out
monitoring trustee).
 Oversee the Applicants' efforts to find a potential buyer, oversee the asset
transfer, and certify potential buyers are given sufficient information on the
business. Once a buyer has been defined, the monitoring trustee writes a
report to CADE explaining how the suggested buyer satisfies the
requirements and if the business is being sold according to the
commitments made in the Merger Control Agreement. At the end of the
process, the monitoring trustee supervises the business' legal and effective
transfer and writes a final report attesting to the transfer (divestiture
process monitoring trustee).
 Guide and supervise the activities of the operating trustee, which are related
to the day-to-day operations of the business to be divested. The operating
trustee manages the business until the divestiture process is completed,
preserving the divested business and ensuring its independence from the
Applicants' other businesses (hold separate monitoring trustee).
5.1.2 Operating trustee
An operating trustee is the manager specifically appointed to manage the asset
package whilst it is not transferred to the buyer. The monitoring trustee is tasked with
giving instructions and supervising the activities of the operating trustee, which are
related to the day-to-day operations of the business to be divested.
Operating trustees also inform the team involved in the divested business on the
divestiture process and its implications on the rights and duties of this team.
43This trustee must be timely appointed, according to the deadlines set forth in the
Merger Control Agreement or in the decision issued by CADE. The Applicants must
carry out every instruction of the operating trustee connected to the implementation of
remedies. An operating trustee works under the supervision of both CADE and of the
monitoring trustee, never of the Applicants.
5.1.3 Divestiture trustee
Where the parties cannot find the divestiture package a suitable buyer within the
set time frame, a divestiture trustee is appointed to carry out the divestiture process. As
with the monitoring trustee, parties must appoint a divestiture trustee to ensure the
effectiveness of the commitments undertaken in the Merger Control Agreement.
A divestiture trustee does not receive any instructions for the Applicants in
selling the divestiture package. During the auction the trustee sells the package at best
possible price and is not necessarily bound to a reserve price. The buyer, in turn, must
satisfy the requirements set forth in the decision that included the remedy.
The divestiture trustee is given a mandate to conduct the business transfer within
the established time frame. A divestiture trustee's mandate is exclusive, irrevocable, and
subject to the supervision of CADE in order to complete the transfer by the deadline set.
The commitments must provide that the parties support and inform the
divestiture trustee in the same manner as for the monitoring trustee. The parties must
grant, through power of attorney, extensive powers in all divestiture stages.
5.2 Additional information
5.2.1 Timing of appointment
It is crucial that a monitoring trustee assumes his or her role as fast as possible.
Thus, the parties must suggest a suitable trustee in a timely manner and by the agreed
deadline. The agreement may include a provision establishing the merger or acquisition
can only be consummated after CADE nominates a monitoring trustee.
Unlike the monitoring trustee, a divestiture trustee should be appointed where
the first deadline for divestiture is missed. A divestiture trustee's mandate comes into
effect when the time frame set for its intervention starts.
5.2.2 Requirements
CADE will assess the necessary requirements in the light of the circumstances of
each case, which includes geographic factors and the economic sector at issue. Auditing
and consulting companies are potential candidates for the position of monitoring trustee,
as they usually perform the duties of this position with success. Likewise, individuals
44with experience in the sector of the economy at issue are potentially suitable candidates,
as long as they have the resources needed to perform this role. As for divestiture
trustees, investment banks are particularly fitting8.
Trustees should be independent from the parties9, have the necessary
qualifications to meet the obligations prescribed in the mandate, and should not be
subject to conflicts of interest.
Conflicts of interest arise when a trustee is linked to a firm owned by the
business group of an Applicant, either as a shareholder or through a financial link. A
conflict of interest also exists where a trustee provides economically relevant services to
the Applicants — e.g. legal consulting, auditing services, as an investment bank, etc. In
cases where a conflict of interest arises during a trustee's mandate, the competition
authority must be immediately informed. In these situations, CADE requires the parties
to terminate the mandate of the trustee and appoint a new one.
Finally, the parties should provide CADE with the necessary information for it to
confirm the trustee satisfies the mandatory requirements.
Divestiture trustees should meet the same requirements as monitoring trustees
with regard to qualifications, credentials, resources. Their appointment process,
mandate, and compensation also follow the same rules. Thus, an individual or firm
appointed as a monitoring trustee can also be appointed as a divestiture trustee.
5.2.3 Selection of a trustee
According to the case, the monitoring trustee and the divestiture trustee may be
the same person or institution. As for the selection of a trustee, unless otherwise
specified in Merger Control Agreement, the Applicants should first prepare a list of
candidates and submit it to CADE. The agency may confirm all nominations, in which
case the Applicants are entitled to nominate the one that suits them best. In cases where
CADE rejects all proposed candidates, applicants should prepare a list with new
candidates.
The submission of the candidates must also include a work plan covering the
procedures, mechanisms, and monitoring stages of the remedy so as to enable CADE to
verify whether the proposal grants the trustee the powers and duties necessary to
supervise the execution of the obligations of the Merger Control Agreement.
8 A monitoring trustee, specifically, may or not be an auditing firm. It is important for a trustee to be
capable of monitoring the Merger Control Agreement, not only in relation to accounting and finances, but
also to the affected market. Failure to fulfil these conditions may lead to the rejection of a candidate for
trustee. Furthermore, the trustee may also be replaced within the duration of the agreement in case he or
she fails to deliver reports that enable a proper assessment of compliance with the agreement.
9 Depending on the case, an operating trustee may be an employee of the merging firm. This may be the
case, for instance, when a given person is part of the key personnel needed to preserve the viability of the
business.
455.2.4 CADE approval
CADE is tasked with, at its own discretion, ascertain the candidates for trustee
are suitable for the roles to be performed in each case. The agency's approval of a
trustee is conditioned on an appropriate mandate. Where suitable, the identity and a
summary of the trustee's duties may be made public by publication. In addition to the
approval of a candidate, the agency must approve the trustee's mandate, which
establishes the rights and obligations of both the trustee and the Applicants.
CADE will endeavour to make a timely analysis of the candidate and decide for
the candidate's approval or rejection. Approval may be contingent on improving or
solving issues in the work plan presented by the trustee; in this case, the hiring depends
on whether the changes suggested by CADE have been adopted.
5.2.5 Duties and obligations of the parties to the appointed trustee
Monitoring, operating, and divestiture trustees must all be nominated based on a
mandate signed between the trustee and the parties. The nomination and mandate are
submitted to CADE for approval.
A trustee's mandate must establish the trustee's duties in the manner provided in
the commitments undertaken, and includes all provisions required for a trustee to fulfil
his or her role.
The signatory must cooperate with the trustee, providing unrestricted access to
all documents, systems, and information necessary for the performance of the trustee's
obligations.
In the same way, the signatories must give the trustee lists of potential buyers;
powers to conduct the asset sale; and, if necessary to fulfil the trustee's duties and
obligations, pay for consultants (of corporate finance, technical matters, R&D, etc.).
CADE may share confidential information on Applicants with the trustee, who
must sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement related to this information, under the provisions
of the trustee's the mandate.
5.2.6 Compensation
The Applicants are responsible for compensating the trustee in a manner that
does not hinder the trustee's independence from the Applicants nor the trustee's
effectiveness in fulfilling the mandate.
It is important to be aware of a potential problem: the party is the one who pays
the trustee, whilst the trustee's obligation is to the Authority.
46Thus, considering different kinds of mandates, a trustee's compensation varies
according to the complexity and duration of the adopted remedy.
5.2.7 Replacement, dismissal, and renewal of term
A trustee's nomination is, fundamentally, irrevocable. However, in the event a
trustee fails to perform its activities according to the Merger Control Agreement or a
conflict of interest arises, CADE may require the Applicants to replace the trustee.
Alternatively, the Applicants may seek CADE's permission to replace the trustee
themselves.
The mandate of a trustee must provide for the trustee's exemption from further
liabilities to CADE when the obligations set in the mandate have been fulfilled, e.g. (i)
the signing of a sale contract, (ii) the transfer of assets to the buyer, and (iii) compliance
with specific post-divestiture agreements.
However, even where such exemption has been given, a trustee may be
renominated if CADE later considers relevant obligations were not fully or satisfactorily
met.
476 Monitoring of Merger Control Agreements
Every remedy contains monitoring obligations, which include gathering and
reporting to CADE information on the development of the business and of the
commitments set forth in the remedy. From this information, CADE will be able to
examine whether the remedies are being applied or not.
This examination is also important to anticipate problems and avoid conflicts
with the obligations, which would incur considerable expenses for the Government or
the parties.
Monitoring also creates direct costs related to the collection, organisation,
submission, and processing of information received by CADE. These costs can be kept
to a minimum if the information is well substantiated and details how successful the
remedy was in attaining its goals. Some ways to reduce monitoring expenses include
defining the scope of information, the frequency of information submission, and the role
of the monitoring trustee.
Defining the scope of information may include an examination of the
competitive capacity of the assets to be divested (such as current turnover), information
on the buyers involved in the negotiations after the preliminary phase, amongst others.
The frequency of information submission may change according to the remedy's stage
of implementation.
CADE strongly advises the participation of a monitoring trustee should be
considered, either to supervise the sale for the parties or to supervise compliance with
the indicators and goals defined in the remedy. Such monitoring trustees have a specific
mandate, report directly to CADE, and are compensated by the Applicants.
The established monitoring obligations do not conflict with the provision for
access to the facilities and investigations into the merging firms aimed at collecting
additional information to inspect compliance with the obligations. The agreed remedies
must provide for this access, following due process.
6.1 Monitoring by CADE vs. monitoring by a trustee
Under Article 52 of Law 12529/2011 and at the discretion of CADE's Tribunal,
the Office of the Superintendent General may monitor compliance with the
commitments and agreements10.
10 Article 52. After the Tribunal issues its judgement, and at its own discretion, it may send the
proceedings to the Office of the Superintendent General, which will analyse compliance with the
judgement and with agreements and commitments signed under this Law.
(1) In inspecting the observance of the Tribunal’s decision and of the agreements and commitments
signed under this Law, the Office of the Superintendent General can make use of every investigating
48The Enforcement of Judgements Office, part of the Office of the Attorney
General at CADE, prepares opinions on the development and monitoring of the parties'
out-of-court compliance with CADE's judgements, Cease and Desist Agreements, and
Merger Control Agreements. Whenever possible, public versions of these opinions are
prepared, allowing interested third parties to offer their comments and participate in
CADE's assessment.
Under CADE's Resolution 6 of 3 April 2003, the Office of the Attorney General
at CADE issues a document analysing compliance with commitments, agreements, and
the Tribunal's judgement. Following, the Office of the Superintendent General may
request information or documents necessary to this analysis, which in turn must be
confirmed by the Tribunal's President.
In a Merger Control Agreement, CADE's compliance assessment must verify if
rules such as deadlines related to each stage of the remedy have been observed; and
look into the remedy's effects, analysing the impact and success of the implemented
measures.
The supervision conducted by the trustee, on the other hand, must stay under the
lead of CADE. It is not feasible for the competition authority to regularly supervise if
commitments are being met. Hence, the competition authority advises the Applicants to
appoint a monitoring trustee, who oversees the performance of the commitments
undertaken by the applicants during the divestiture process.
As mentioned before, the duties of a monitoring trustee include preserving the
divested business up to its transfer, monitoring the carve-out process of the divestiture
package, searching for an appropriate buyer, and tracking compliance with behavioural
remedies.
Thus, a trustee supports the competition authority in the monitoring process and
parties' observance of obligations, according to the provisions of the trustee's mandate.
Therefore, amongst the many duties of a trustee, the position requires regularly writing
reports to the agency informing it about the parties' compliance with the obligations of
the remedies.
These reports must include an executive summary detailing the performance of
commitments (whether behavioural or structural). To this end, a trustee must describe
the procedures adopted during the monitoring process, the evidence collected, and the
rationale behind his/her conclusions11.
power provided for in this Law.
(2) Once the Tribunal’s decision, Merger Control Agreement, or Cease and Desist Agreement has been
fulfilled, the Office of the Superintendent General, on its own motion or at request of an interested party,
provides a statement of compliance (Law 12529/2011).
11 In case the monitoring is conducted by independent auditors, assurance reports delivered to CADE
49The reports may also include additional information about the fulfilment of
commitments as to the trustee's view on the performance of obligations; in this case, the
trustee must explain the reasons for the addition to CADE12. Such information will be
taken into account according to the case. Where there are doubts on whether the
obligations have been met, the parties may be heard.
Thus, it can be stated that one of the tasks of a monitoring trustee is to mitigate
the asymmetry of information between CADE and the Applicants.
6.2 Sanctions and penalties
A Merger Control Agreement must provide for the possibility of CADE
reconsidering the clearance given to a transaction where an Applicant violates Article
91 of Law 12529/2011 and/or of applying daily fines for non-compliance or delays as to
the obligations established by the Agreement. The penalties should be proportional to
the severity of the non-compliance and, in case of a financial penalty, take into account
the firm's turnover.
Fines and penalties are split into (i) fines for non-compliance with main
obligations and (ii) fines for non-compliance with ancillary obligations. Main
obligations are those related to divestiture, asset sale, doing or failing to do something:
that is, obligations to prevent competition concerns from arising. Ancillary obligations
comprise the documents, reports, and any other obligations aimed at informing CADE
about the observance of main obligations. For instance, every six months a trustee's
report should be presented, and failing to do so incurs a penalty. Moreover, there are
fines related to non-compliance with specific commitments and daily fines for delays
(of reports, for instance).
Where a Merger Control Agreement has been partially or entirely reneged, the
Agreement must provide for the reconsideration of the transactions referred to in Article
91 of Law 12529/2011, in addition to other implications (such as having the transaction
(whether limited or reasonable, depending on the needs of the remedy package) must be "long form"
(forma longa) prepared observing Paragraph 48 of the NBC TO 3000 standards: the reports must "detail
the terms of the engagement, criteria applied, remarks on specific aspects of the engagement, and, in
some cases, recommendations and basic elements. Any remarks and recommendations by an independent
auditor must be clearly separated from its conclusion, and be phrased so as to ensure there is no intention
of them detracting from the conclusion. The auditor may use titles, paragraph numeration, formatting
such as bold, and other ways to improve the report's clarity and readability."
12 In case the monitoring is conducted by independent auditors, assurance reports delivered to CADE
(whether limited or reasonable, depending on the needs of the remedy package), Paragraph 50 of NBC
TO 3000 provides that "an independent auditor may include in the assurance report other information and
explanations not intended to change its conclusion. For instance, details on the qualifications and
experience of the auditor and others involved with the engagement, disclosure of materiality levels,
comments on the engagement, and recommendations. The inclusion of this information depends on its
relevance to the needs of the intended user. This additional information must be clearly separated from
the conclusion of the auditor and be phrased so as to ensure it does not affect the auditor's conclusion.
50undone or the clearance reconsidered).
If the signatories fail to meet any of the deadlines or commitments prescribed in
the Merger Control Agreement, CADE provides them with the opportunity to express
their views and reasons within the period detailed in the Agreement; if the Agreement
does not refer to such a period, the parties have five days to do so.
6.3 Amendments to Merger Control Agreements
Following the signature of a Merger Control Agreement, the signatories may,
under exceptional circumstances and presenting their reasons for it, request the agency
to amend the Agreement, i.e. to delete, change, or replace the obligations established by
it. The agency may extend the time limits provided by the agreement at request of the
signatories or, where appropriate, on its own motion or by request of the Office of the
Superintendent General.
Any such amendments require the Tribunal's approval. Rejection of such
amendments to a Merger Control Agreement might lead to obligations not being met. In
these circumstances, CADE may reconsider the transaction, as established by Article 91
of Law 12529/2011.
517 Compliance with Merger Control Agreements
The examination of whether obligations have been fulfilled should be clear and
legally verifiable, without placing an excessive burden on the parties or CADE,
particularly in the case of behavioural remedies.
In addition to CADE's use of supervisors or trustees — who are compensated by
the parties — to obtain the information necessary to meet the obligations, a Merger
Control Agreement may include provisions for the investigation and on-site information
gathering, aimed at fulfilling obligations.
Non-compliance constitutes failing to meet main commitments (e.g. not
divesting, selling devalued assets) or ancillary ones (related to supervision or
information, such as not writing reports or delivering them incomplete).
These may lead to fixed, daily, cumulative fines or even blocking the
transaction. A statement of non-compliance adopts the procedures needed for its
consideration by the Tribunal. Non-compliance with the obligations does not induce a
review of agreements or terms of a decision. A Merger Control Agreement must always
constitute an executable instrument, so as to ensure its enforcement before the Judiciary.
The verification of compliance with the remedies required for merger clearance
is carried out by the Office of the Attorney General at CADE and the Office of the
Superintendent General. The latter forwards it to the Tribunal, which is responsible for
putting it for a vote.
During a merger review, the best pieces of available information are used, with
the appropriate methodologies, to predict the transaction's effects on the competitive
environment and, where necessary, to design and implement remedies. However, over
time, the effects of a transaction may divert from its predicted path. In order to enhance
CADE's decision-making, the Department of Economic Studies may carry out post-
merger studies on the impact of a merger or acquisition — including of the remedies
imposed — as a regular procedure. This study of a merger and its remedies seeks to
determine, through quantitative and qualitative techniques, the effects of a decision on
the market after some time. It will be used to assess the validity of the remedies and is a
relevant source of information to restructure or complement the measures in force.
528 Additional information
8.1 Regulated sectors
The existence of a regulator for a specific sector does not prevent CADE from
imposing remedies where it deems necessary to protect competition. The competition
authority aims at complementing, whenever needed, the requirements of the sector's
regulator. The remedies CADE applies on those sectors must interact with the sector's
rules to make them more efficient. CADE and the regulatory agency may establish a
connection to make the remedies more suitable for the regulatory framework of the
sector
in cases where this is relevant for the economic activities developed in the
markets negatively affected by the transaction. The parties must observe the regulatory
prerequisites and the deadlines for obtaining the licences, authorisations, and statements
needed to conduct a business in that sector. CADE cannot influence the development of
proceedings nor the regulatory procedures unless a collaboration with the regulatory
agency had been previously established or the regulatory agency changes its own
procedures.
Conversely, in regulated sectors that demand exchange of information between
the regulator and the regulated firms, remedies must provide for manners to monitor and
inspect compliance that include this flow of information, thus contributing for a timely,
feasible, and proportional remedy.
8.2 International cooperation
Whether conducted abroad with effects in Brazil or conducted in Brazil with
effects in foreign jurisdictions, a merger review and its judgement are always
independent from other jurisdictions.
It is possible the same merger is target of a concurrent and parallel review, in
Brazil and abroad. In these cases, cooperation between authorities is desirable for
designing, implementing, and monitoring the remedies. This mitigates the risks of
having opposing or inconsistent remedies, whilst preserving the sovereignty of the
affected countries and the independence of the competition authorities involved.
The cooperation may include sharing information on the remedy, both before
and after the transaction is adjudicated. The exchange of confidential information
demands previous consent from the firms, which may be done through a Waiver of
Confidentiality. To this end, CADE has a bilingual Portuguese-English version of the
document available for companies (Annex B).
53In case of coordinated remedies, it is preferable to have a single trustee for both
jurisdictions, so as to ensure more consistency in the implementation and monitoring of
the remedies.
The remedies adopted by CADE may be the same adopted by foreign authorities,
provided that the parties fulfil their obligations in Brazil during the several stages of
monitoring and implementation. In this context, CADE requires a Merger Control
Agreement is signed in Brazil, so that the agreement's main and ancillary obligations are
honoured in the country as well.
54Annexes
Annex A – Glossary
Information asymmetry: unbalance in the access to information by two agents that
interact with one another. The unbalance may create failures or inefficiency in resource
allocation in a market.
Carve-out: the separation of a business unit from the structure of a firm. In this case, the
business to be separated is not autonomous.
Thus, the carve-out process may require the assets or personnel are doubled so as to
ensure the divested business is viable and competitive.
Chinese wall (firewall): a behavioural remedy aimed at restricting access to confidential
information within a merged firm. In the case of a vertical integration, for instance,
information is not shared between the upstream and downstream departments of the
verticalised firm.
Consummation of the transaction (consummation of the merger, closing the deal):
changes in the physical structure and competitive conditions of the parties involved in
the merger. These changes comprise asset transfers, influence of one party over the
other, and the exchange of competitively sensitive information that is not strictly
necessary for the signature of a formal document that binds the parties (the purchase and
sale agreement).
Consummation of the divestiture: transferring to the purchaser the assets; contractual
relationships (i.e. contracts with suppliers and clients, lease agreements, use of
distribution channels, amongst others); and authorisations and permits (e.g. a business
licence) required for the operation of the divested business.
Crown jewels: where the first deadline for divestiture is missed, it is replaced or
complemented by an alternate or additional divestiture (called crown jewels). Thus, the
divestiture package extends beyond markets where the transaction raises competition
concerns, aiming to attract potential buyers in new markets.
Empty shell: a divestiture whose asset package that is empty. It may occur where the
human resources of a divestiture package are difficult to identify or transfer, whether by
the employees' will or issues with the labour legislation.
Fix-it-first: a structural remedy offered by the Applicants during a merger review, in
which a purchaser and an asset package are selected before the merger is cleared. This
remedy may provide the Applicants with more flexibility in designing the divestiture
package.
55Mix and match: divestitures that combine assets and business segments of more than
one Applicant.
Moral hazard: market players tend to change their behaviour after signing a contract.
This happens because individuals have bounded rationality, that is, they cannot
anticipate all circumstances entailed in a business relationship. For instance, in the
health insurance market, people tend to demand more services than they would if
uninsured.
Key personnel: the personnel necessary for keeping the divested business viable and
competitive.
Price-cap: a model of regulation with incentives, where price caps are fixed for a given
period. As a consequence, companies look for efficiency gains and cost reductions to
make better profits. For instance, in the CPI-X regime, price caps reflect the rate of
inflation minus the efficiency savings expected until the price caps are next reviewed.
Limited Assurance Report: it seeks to reduce engagement risk to an acceptable level in
the circumstances of the engagement but where the risk is higher than that of a
Reasonable Assurance engagement. It supports an independent auditor's conclusion in a
negative form, i.e. that he or she is not aware of any relevant changes that should be
made in the information used in the engagement.
Reasonable Assurance Report: it seeks to reduce engagement risk to an acceptably low
level in the circumstances of the engagement. It supports an independent auditor's
conclusion and expresses it in a positive form.
Applicants or Parties: companies applying for a merger or acquisition.
Ring-fencing: unlike a Chinese Wall, which takes place within the merged firm, a ring-
fencing blocks information sharing between the seller and the package of assets to be
divested. It is a separating measure aimed to protect trade secrets or other confidential
information regarding the divestiture.
Trustee: one or more individuals or legal entities appointed by the signatories and
confirmed by CADE where there is a Merger Control Agreement. A trustee's main
duties include the following: i) preserving the business to be divested; ii) monitoring the
carve-out process of the divestiture package; iii) holding the divestiture package
separate from the other businesses of the seller; iv) monitoring the signatories'
compliance with the conditions and obligations established by the Merger Control
Agreement (e.g. the process of selecting an appropriate buyer, compliance with the
obligations of a behavioural remedy, where applicable); and v) enabling the sale of the
divested business.
56Upfront buyer: a remedy in which the purchaser is selected after merger clearance, and
is a prerequisite for its consummation.
57Annex B – Trustee mandate
Identification (i) of the parties (signatories) and (ii) the trustee.
Identification of the decision that ordered the nomination of a trustee, informing: (i) The
type of decision (a Merger Control Agreement in a merger or a Cease and Desist
Agreement in an investigation into an anticompetitive practice); (ii) the legal provisions
that support the decision and negotiated measures.
According to the decision above, the party(ies) or signatory(ies) commitment to (sum up
the structural and/or behavioural obligations set by the agreement).
Definitions:
Parties: firm A, firm B.
Obligations: a group of behavioural and/or structural remedies that compose the duties
to be fulfilled by the parties throughout the implementation of the agreement.
Monitoring trustee: responsible for monitoring the divestiture process and the
maintenance of the divested business or, in the case of behavioural remedies, for
verifying whether the obligations about what to do and what not to do are being
properly fulfilled.
Divestiture trustee: responsible for organising the sale of assets where the parties failed
to complete the divestiture process by the first deadline.
Operating trustee: responsible for managing the divestiture package whilst it is not
transferred to the buyer. The specific duties of an operating trustee must be established
according to the specificities of the case.
Work plan: a plan each potential trustee must present to CADE so the authority is able
to decide between the options offered by the signatories.
1. Trustee nomination
CADE names a monitoring trustee after the parties submit their candidates by the
deadline set in the agreement.
After nomination, the trustee must fully adhere to the terms of the mandate, starting at
the nomination date, and is thereafter bound by the obligations and deadlines set in the
agreement and mandate.
The trustee's personal staff is made up of the following professionals: (...) without
prejudice to hiring additional professionals to provide specific services (such as audit,
reporting, etc.).
CADE nominates a divestiture trustee after the first deadline for divestiture expires,
according to the deadlines agreed.
58From the moment of nomination, the divestiture trustee also adheres to the terms of the
mandate and the obligations set in the agreement.
The divestiture trustee's staff is introduced from the moment of a trustee's nomination,
where necessary.
2. General duties of a trustee
A trustee must work towards the fulfilment of the obligations assumed by the
signatories, and exclusively on behalf of CADE. A trustee must follow the work plan
approved by CADE. Nonetheless, the approval does not prevent the authority from
requesting changes and imposing additional measures when deemed required for the
performance of the responsibilities assumed.
3. General duties of signatories
Signatories and their legal representatives must provide all necessary conditions for the
fulfilment of a trustee's mandate, intending to meet the assumed obligations. To this
end, signatories must grant full, unrestricted access to the parties' facilities, especially to
the assets to be divested, information systems, ledgers, personnel, technical information,
amongst others that become necessary for the implementation of the mandate. Access to
these resources and assets must be granted within a reasonable time so as not to hinder
or unduly postpone the work conducted by the trustee.
Moreover, the signatories must provide the trustee and the trustee's staff with the
financial and material resources necessary to support the work being carried out.
The signatories must also keep the trustee informed about every relevant aspect of the
assumed obligations, such as: making a list of potential asset buyers, ongoing
negotiations, offered conditions, deadlines for implementation, business plan, and any
obstacles to the performance of obligations, amongst others.
In case a trustee deems appropriate to hire experts to perform specific tasks, such as an
auditor, technical expert, etc., these professionals must be provided by the signatories
within a reasonable time.
4. Duties of a monitoring trustee
These are the duties monitoring trustee (who, where necessary, should act jointly
with an operating trustee):
 monitor the maintenance of the divested business, the viability of the
business, and the competitiveness of its assets until they are transferred;
 ensure the parties do not take any action aimed at, or that may result in the
assets' loss of value, competitiveness, or attractiveness;
59 ensure the signatories offer all necessary resources for preserving the
assets until the obligation is in force; and
 ensure the assets to be transferred form an independent unit, separate from
the signatory, so as to maintain the assets' competitiveness when they are
removed from the parties' structure.
In cases where there are behavioural obligations, a monitoring trustee has the
following duties:
 Monitor the signatories' compliance with the duties and prohibitions
assumed by them.
 Require, if need be, actions taken by the signatories are corrected, so as to meet
the obligations assumed in the agreement and according to CADE's
requirements.
 Seeking to ensure full compliance with the behavioural responsibilities
undertaken, a trustee and the trustee's staff should be granted unrestricted
access to the parties' facilities. Furthermore, where necessary, the trustee is
allowed to participate in meetings, negotiations with third parties
potentially affected by the obligations (clients, competitors, suppliers), and
interviews with third parties (with the third parties' consent), preserving
the confidentiality of the signatories.
A monitoring trustee must inform CADE of any actions or omissions by the signatories
that may jeopardise the fulfilment of the assumed responsibilities and of the
mandate, so that CADE may intervene or inspect compliance with the obligations.
5. Duties of a divestiture trustee
A divestiture trustee is nominated after the first deadline for divestiture is expired,
taking on the duty of transferring the assets described in the agreement. These are
the duties of a divestiture trustee:
 indicate the criteria for the asset sale (reserve price, zero bid prices, etc.);
 indicate a deadline for divestiture;
 indicate the criteria for selecting potential buyers; and
 report to CADE and comply with the authority's orders.
6. Obligation to inform
A monitoring/divestiture trustee must present regular reports to CADE (establish
the frequency according to the case or duration of the obligations). In the reports,
the trustee must inform CADE on the following:
 Performance of structural/behavioural obligations.
60 Compliance with action plan and negotiated deadlines.
 Compliance with the obligations taken on by the signatories. In case of non-
compliance, the trustee should state the reasons for it, detailing the
signatories' liability or if it occurred as a result of force majeure.
 Whether the obligations have been met or not, a trustee must identify the
actions taken in response to the signatories' behaviour aimed at ensuring the
fulfilment of the obligations. A trustee must detail such actions, in addition to
the signatories' efforts in adopting the recommendations, and their compliance
or non-compliance with any of the obligations.
The trustee is the sole responsible for presenting the reports. The deadlines
provided in the agreement must be observed, subject to fines for delay or for not
presenting the reports. In case the signatories explain their delay or incomplete
reports, the trustee must report it to CADE in detail so that the authority decides
on issuing a statement of non-compliance with the agreement.
7. Conflict of interest
A trustee and the trustee's staff cannot have a conflict of interest with the signatories
(report potential conflicts).
Where a conflict of interest rises, the trustee must immediately report it to CADE, and
the authority may require the trustee or a member of the trustee's staff to be replaced.
8. Conclusion
The compensation of the trustee, the trustee's staff, and any additional professionals
hired is a responsibility of the signatories of the agreement.
This compensation must seek the trustee's independence from the signatories and should
not encourage a situation where the interests of a trustee are aligned with those of the
signatories; where this is the case, CADE may penalise the parties.
CADE suggests a divestiture trustee's compensation should be bound to the deadline for
divestiture.
The trustee's compensation must be included in the action plan submit to CADE for
analysis. The trustee mandate ends only when CADE declares all obligations have been
met, unless otherwise specified.
